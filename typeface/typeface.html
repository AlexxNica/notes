	I know almost nothing about typography.  I know so little that
	I don't even know the difference between a typeface and a
	font.  But it seems to me that using fonts well is a super
	power, the kind of ability that can substantially enhance any
	media we create.  It's worth taking time to understand some
	basics.

      <p>
	If you've somehow stumbled across these notes, be warned: they
	are the working notes of an absolute beginner.  I know less
	about fonts than a child going to their third violin class
	knows about the violin.  You should expect to wince roughly as
	much.

      <p>
	In keeping with the last paragraph, I shall commit numerous
	crimes against typography in these notes.  Indeed, I shall
	actively seek out opportunities to commit such crimes.  It's a
	sketchbook for experimentation, not a portfolio piece.

      <p>
	Understanding typography may be a super power, but it's not
	one that I will ever master.  My intent here is to: (a) answer
	a few of my basic questions about typography; (b) develop the
	rudiments of a basic technique; (c) create notes for later
	reference and review; and (d) get my brain seriously engaged
	with questions about typography.  Point (d), especially, will
	help begin a long-term process of learning.

      <p>
	I specifically <em>don't</em> want to go too far down this
	rabbit hole.  It clearly is something one can spend a lifetime
	on.  But I suspect that one can get a considerable fraction of
	the benefit by spending an intense 10-20 hours engaged with
	the subject.  That's not enough to obtain any kind of deep
	insight, but will lay the foundation for repeated brief future
	engagement, further questions, and learning from other
	people's theory and practice.

      <p>
	<h2>What's the difference between a typeface and a font?</h2>

      <p>
	According
	to <a href="http://www.thefloatingfrog.co.uk/tips-tricks-tutorials/what-is-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface/">this
	article</a>, Adobe says that "a font is one weight, width, and
	style of a typeface".  In particular, 12 point bold Garamond
	is a different font from 18 point italic Garamond.  But both
	are instances of the same typeface or, perhaps more correctly,
	the same type family.  According
	to <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface">this
	article</a>, the distinction between fonts and typefaces has
	largely faded in recent years.  Indeed, the terms have become
	muddled to the point where even graphic designers may
	interchange them.  So it's not worth worrying much about. The
	caveat is that one may wish to be observant about how other
	people use the terms: some people <em>do</em> still use them
	quite precisely.  When talking with such a person it will aid
	communication to be sensitive to their language, and to try to
	speak it myself.  In these notes I shall use the term "font"
	for the most part, since that seems to be the most common
	useage.

      <p>
	<h2>Classification and examples</h2>

      <p>
	The classification is one I found
	in <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/14/what-font-should-i-use-five-principles-for-choosing-and-using-typefaces/">this
	article</a>.  I have also seen many of these terms used
	elsewhere.

      <p>
	<strong>Geometric Sans:</strong> Fonts based on the simplest
	geometric forms, typically with strokes that are the same
	width.   Here's an example:


      <p style="font: 18pt 'Century Gothic'">
	<strong>Century Gothic:</strong> I don't much like the
	kerning.  It seems uneven.

      <p style="font: 12pt 'Century Gothic'">
	Century Gothic works better at the smaller size (12pt).  I
	still see the unevenness, but it seems considerably reduced.
	The font is somewhat similar to Helvetica, in that it's based
	on very simple geometric forms, with little elaboration. It's
	a wider font than Helvetica, especially for curved letters
	such as "c" and "u".  Those letters tend to be emphasized at
	the expense of narrow letters such as "t" and "l".

      <p>
	<strong>Humanist Sans:</strong> These fonts are a little more
	individualized than Geometric Sans fonts, with more variation
	in stroke width and endings.  An example is Verdana:

      <p style="font: 36px Verdana">
	Verdana: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy gray dogs.

      <p style="font: 36px Arial">
	Arial (this is geometric sans, not humanist sans): The quick
	brown fox jumped over the lazy gray dogs.

      <P>
	Laying Verdana and Arial out side-by-side, they really are
	quite similar, apart from the spacing.  Another significant
	difference is that the tail of the Arial "y" is is curved,
	while the tail of the Verdana y is not.  For the most part I
	slightly prefer the Arial letters.  But Arial does feel just a
	tiny bit squashed compared to Verdana.  Look at the two
	lowercase occurrences of "the" in the sentence: I prefer the
	Verdana, since the "t" isn't so narrowed down.

      <p>
	For the most part I don't notice the geometric sans versus
	humanist sans nature of the two fonts.  If anything, Arial
	seems just a little more varied.

      <p>
	Apparently Verdana's creator created it in the 1990s for
	Microsoft, and was somewhat bound by the limits of screens of
	the time.  Reminds me of David Byrne's idea that music evolves
	in response to architecture and technology; so too does
	typography. Since screens and form factors are likely to
	change enormously over the next fifty years, it seems likely
	that will drive an ongoing renaissance in typographic design.

      <p>
	<strong>Old Style:</strong> These are the early serif fonts.
	A classic example is Garamond:
	
      <p style="font: 36px Garamond">
	Garamond: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy gray dogs.

      <p>
	<strong>Transitional and modern fonts:</strong> An outgrowth
	of the old style, but with much more emphasis on contrasting
	thick and thin strokes.

      <p style="font: 48px Times New Roman">
	Times New Roman: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy gray
	dogs.

      <p>
	<strong>Slab serif:</strong> Strokes like sans faces:
	relatively unvarying in thicknesss.  But with solid "slabs"
	for serifs.

      <p style="font: 48px Courier New">
	Courier: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy gray dogs.

	<p>
	  <h2>Concepts</h2>
      <p>
	<strong>Font stacks:</strong> A list of fallback fonts so that
	a website will degrade gracefully.  You don't so much want
	fonts as you want font stacks.

      <p>
	<strong>x-height:</strong>The distance between the baseline
	and the mean line.  Typically the height of the "x", "u", "v",
	"w" and "z".

      <p>
	<strong>Cap height:</strong> The height of the capital
	letters.

      <p>
	If the x-height is too close to the Cap height that will make
	it harder to distinguish upper and lowercase letters.  On the
	other hand, a large x-height does help legibility, e.g., in
	distinguishing "c" and "e".


      <p>
	<h2>What do fonts do for us?</h2>

	
      <p>
	Used well, they can do the following things:

      <p>
	They can make text easily <em>readable</em>.  This sounds
	trivial, but is not, since some fonts do the opposite: they
	make it hard to read.  I do not know what makes a font good
	for readability.

      <p>
	They can make text <em>striking</em>.  This can be useful to
	draw the eye.  I don't know what makes a font striking,
	although (as with most people) I often know it when I see it.

      <p>
	They can make text easily <em>scannable</em>, to pick out an
	item of note.  I don't know what makes a font scannable.

      <p>
	The can help us <em>find things quickly</em>.
	Consider <a href="http://worrydream.com/quotes/">this</a>:
	
      <p>
	<img src="finding.jpg">

      <p>
	We can quickly skim through and identity the names of the
	people being quoted, the sources, and the actual quotes.  Of
	course, the layout helps a great deal, as well, but it's in
	tandem with the fonts.  In general it's the layout + font +
	color combination which makes things easy to find.  I've
	tended to focus on layour and color, but font is also
	extremely important in this.

      <p>
	Summing up, I believe the most important thing is to pick
	a <em>readable</em> font, and to consider font choices
	carefully when laying out a page.  In particular, using
	sharply contrasting fonts (face, weight, size) can help the
	reader better understand a page, and navigate faster.

      <p>
	<h2>What's the advantage to having many fonts, then?</h2>

      <p>
	A natural response to the comments in the last section is that
	we should just find a dozen or so fonts that are good,
	flexible fonts, and then use combinations of those.  Why do
	any more?

      <p>
	For many purposes, that is correct, and I should begin working
	on finding a go-to list of fonts.

      <p>
	However, to create a <em>special</em> feel for an experience,
	an unusual font or combination of fonts can be very helpful.
	The font choices may not be something the reader is
	particularly aware of, but may help create a lasting
	impression of something unique.

      <p>
	My reading suggests that a lot of the font design work going
	on today is in response to the needs of corporations.  When
	launching a new product, a wealthy corporation may commission
	a type designer to design a new font for them.  Think of the
	"Coca-Cola" logo, which
	was <a href="http://fontmeme.com/coca-cola-font/">apparently</a>
	done in Spencerian script*<span class="marginnote">* This was
	a very common font in the 19th century, and Coke certainly
	didn't create it.  However, today it's a good example of using
	a font to brand a product.</span>:

      <p>
	<img src="coke.jpg">

      <p>
	I guess that's an extreme example, but reading around I learnt
	that many products have their own unique fonts.  A fun site to
	look through is <a href="http://fontmeme.com/">fontmeme</a>,
	which lists the fonts for many products.

      <p>
	The takeaway for me is perhaps limited.  I really should aim
	to understand a dozen or so core fonts: when to use them and
	what combinations to use.  I suspect I don't yet know enough
	to be more adventurous in making font choices: I would need to
	do more research, and work with knowledgeable
	people*<span class="marginnote">* It's worth being skeptical
	about that knowledge.  As I read it is becoming clear that
	some designers like to speak nonsense when they justify
	typographic choices.  They're often font snobs who know
	little, and fall back on very strongly stated (but
	unjustified) beliefs about subjective crieria.  Conversely,
	many designers are also deeply knowledgeable.  The problem is
	that as someone who is very ignorant, it can be hard for me to
	tell the two classes apart.  (It took a lot of reading to
	realize with confidence that this was going on).  So you'd
	want to push people on lots of specific questions.  If they
	don't have insightful, thoughtful things to say, work with
	another designer.</span>.


      <p>
	<h2>Miscellanea</h2>

      <p>
	<strong>Typography is a universe:</strong> There are
	conferences, big events, awards, and so on.

      <p>
	One naturally wonders: is it worth it?  Are we still getting
	typographic breakthroughs, changes in typography that
	substantially enhance the way we relate to text?  I don't know
	enough to know the answer to that question.  Nonetheless, it's
	a fun fact that our society can support this activity!

      <p>
	Type designers seem to be mostly concerned with beauty,
	legibility, the emotional quality of a typographic experience,
	and so on.  Contrast this with the people who invented
	alphabets and words.  Those latter people were creating new
	atoms and moleculues of thought and understanding.  The two
	activities are related, of course, and 

      <p>
	<strong>The innovation in typography suggests an endless
	frontier for interactive design:</strong> Consider the
	thousands of variations on the letter "a" produced by all the
	type designers.  Each year many more variations are released.
	Each represents an aspiration, original thought, and analysis.
	We can do just the same for any design element.  Think of a
	slider, for example.  It's tempting to just think "I'll add a
	slider".  But a slider can have every bit as much (and
	probably more) character and individuality as the letter "a".
	And the same goes for any other user interface element.  A fun
	project: <strong>50 variations on the slider</strong>.

      <p style="font-family: comic sans ms">
	<strong>On Comic Sans:</strong> It's become a marker of taste
	to hate Comic Sans.  I suspect that in many, perhaps most,
	cases, it's largely a feigned hatred.  To have a strong
	opinion on Comic Sans signals membership in the tribe of those
	who know and care (or who would like to be seen as knowing and
	caring) about typography.  I'm sure that for some people this
	is simply an affectation adopted for amusement.  Certainly,
	someone who truly hates a font is suffering from extreme
	first-world problems.  Font designers get a pass from this
	verdict: to be any good they'd need to live inside fonts, and
	it would not be surprising if they become quite sensitive to
	what they see as errors.

      <p style="font: 18pt comic sans ms">
	With that said, the last paragraph is markedly less legible
	than many of the other paragraphs.  The main exception is the
	initial (bold) lede to the paragraph.  I wonder if the issue
	is the size?

      <p style="font: 18pt comic sans ms">
	18 point is reasonably legible when used briefly.

      <p style="font: 12pt comic sans ms">
	But it doesn't work so well at the smaller size (12 point).

      <p>
	<strong>Font snobbery:</strong> Related to the dislike for
	Comic Sans is a certain amount of general font snobbery.
	People shriek their dismay at "appalling" font choices.  In
	some instances, they have a point: a poor colour scheme or
	too-small font can make something unreadable.  But the size of
	the shrieks goes far beyond this.  It's worth actively
	resisting this snobbery, in my opinion.  I suspect that good
	typographers mostly avoid it: (1) they can use strong
	arguments to make their case, rather than loud arguments; and
	(2) they have no need to preen, and lord it over others.
	Summing up, someone with a very strong opinion (and without
	very detailed reasons) is likely a good someone to ignore.

      <p>
	(Why does the snobbery exist?  Good question.  Snobbery can
	occur in any field.  But it seems particularly easy in fields
	where criteria are to some extent subjective.  The lazy snob
	can fall back on loud opinions about those subjective
	criteria.  It can be difficult to question those opinions:
	"But why does Comic Sans looks unprofessional?" "I
	can't <em>believe</em> you're asking me
	that!"*<span class="marginnote">* <a href="http://xkcd.com/1053/">"I
	can't believe you don't know"</a> seems like an anti-signal.
	People who do it are often relatively clueless, and trying to
	act knowledgeable.  This isn't 100 percent reliable as a
	signal &ndash; I know some quite knowledgeable people who do
	it.  But it's a useful indicator.</span>  Etcetera.  The only
	option in these situations is either to move on to something
	else, or if it really matters, to cheerfully confess complete
	ignorance &ndash; and keep drilling down into the question.
	I'm sure that the right person could give me a lot of
	fascinating insights into design errors made in Comic Sans.
	But it's also perfectly clear that some of the people who
	complain the loudest don't have a clue.)

      <p>
	<strong>I tend to be timid in my use of font sizes:</strong>
	Go for contrast.  I suspect my timidity is due to the fact
	that academic text often <em>is</em> fairly conservative.  But
	the result is that I'm on the conservative end of a
	conservative approach.  This makes it harder for the reader to
	navigate than should be the case.  Try making some errors in
	the opposite direction*<span class="marginnote">* After
	writing this I doubled the size of the title font, and
	increased the size of the section fonts.  To be honest, I'm
	still not sure that what I've done is too extreme!  Small
	steps.</span>!

      <p>
	<strong>Use large, flexible font families:</strong> This is
	useful when you'll be doing things like footnotes, marginal
	notes, hyperlinks, and so on: having lots of options makes it
	easier to find things that work.

      <p>
	<strong>Good font combinations tend to be strongly contrasting
	in some strong ways, and very similar in others:</strong> In
	particular, the contrast makes them easy to tell apart.  On
	similarity: it's useful to go for similar widths and
	x-heights, <em>unless</em> you're going for a contrast
	(typically with a very narrow or very wide font).

      <p>
	<strong>Sometimes it's enough to use the same font twice, just
	at different size and weight:</strong> In other words, the
	size and weight can be enough to create a good contrast.
	Sometimes, color, too, especially reverse neutrals (black and
	white, for instance).

      <p>
	<strong>Mix fonts with a similar personality, or mix in a
	neutral:</strong> This is a little like mixing colours.

      <p>
	<strong>Questions I don't have good answers to:</strong>
	What's a good list of go-to fonts?  How to choose line width?
	Line spacing?  Rules of thumb for the size of headings versus
	body text.  At least in part I will begin addressing this with
	the comparisons which follow.  Provisional conclusions:
	Georgia is a pretty good basic serif font, and Lato is a
	pretty good basic sans-serif font, with Open Sans a useful
	backup.

	<h2>Comparison of Times New Roman and Garamond</h2>

      <p style="font: 48pt Times New Roman">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p style="font: 48pt Garamond">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p>
	On top is 48pt Times New Roman.  Bottom is 48pt Garamond.

      <p>
	Garamond is very slightly narrower.

      <p>
	The Garamond strokes are thinner, and there is more variation.
	I personally find that difficult to read at smaller font
	sizes: I'm not much of a fan of Garamond at regular screen
	sizes.

      <p>
	Garamond's loops tend to be a little rounder, while Times is
	more upright.  Look at the c, the d, the e, for example.

      <p>
	Apparently Times New Roman is considered a narrow font, and
	part of the reason is that newspapers prefer narrower fonts (=
	more text on fewer pages, apparently.  This is not as obvious
	as it sounds: the decrease in legibility might need to be
	compensated by using a larger font.  But apparently the
	width-legibility tradeoff tends to make narrower fonts denser
	at the same level of legibility).

      <p>
	Both a's are rather droopy.  The Times b is less elaborate in
	the bottom left.  The c's are similar, but the Times is more
	upright.  Ditto the d's and e's.  The Garamond f has a more
	varied stroke across the middle than does the Times. The g is
	a rare case where the Times font feels a little less upright
	than Garamond.  The h's are very similar, as are the i's.  The
	tail of the Garamond j is very cut off, while the tail of the
	Times j is well rounded.  Skipping along, the Garamond r has a
	droopiness, much like the a.  The serifs on the Times s are
	much more pronouned than Garamond (this is generally true,
	although particularly pronounced for the s).  The Garamond t
	is like the f.  The tail of the Garamond y is a little more
	cut off than the Times y (compare the j).

      <p>
	Summing up: Times is a heavier, more upright font, less
	rounded in the loops (o, b, d, p, q etc).  Garamond seems too
	spindly to me to be a serious screen font for body text.  It
	will work okay at larger sizes.  In general, I think I'd
	prefer Times, unless I was using one of them as a display font
	(unlikely), in which case I suspect it would depend on
	context.

	<h2>Georgia versus Times New Roman</h2>

      <p style="font: 48pt Georgia">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p style="font: 48pt Times New Roman">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p>
	On top is 48pt Georgia.  Bottom is 48pt Times New Roman.

      <p>
	Times is narrower.  Georgia is a bit heavier.  The Georgia
	loops are little flatter, not quite as upright.  I like all
	these differences.  The one obvious thing that I don't like
	about Georgia is that it's a bit more rectilinear.  This is
	perhaps because of its origin as an early computer font, when
	resolutions were very limited.

      <p>
	Standout differences at the letter level: The Georgia f stroke
	is quite a bit heavier.  The dots on the i and j are also
	quite a bit heavier. The Georgia p and q are more symmetric
	(true of b and d as well).  The Georgia r looks a little more
	like Garamond.  The Georgia t's stroke is quite a bit less
	ornate.

      <p>
	Summary: Quite similar.  I think I slightly prefer Georgia:
	it's not quite as squashed.  It may be better in italic, too,
	for this reason.  The downside is the slightly unnatural
	rectilinearity.  I'd be skeptical of using it at large sizes
	for that reason (unless that was the look I needed).  At small
	font sizes I expect it would look better than Times.

	<h2>Georgia versus Palatino</h2>

      <p style="font: 48pt Georgia">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p style="font: 48pt Palatino, 'Palatino Linotype'">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p>
	So Palatino is a little wider than Georgia, and not quite as
	heavy.  It's still significantly heavier than Garamond.  Many
	of the curvy Palatino letters have sharper serifs than
	Georgia.  I prefer the Georgia look.  However, Palatino
	doesn't have the same rectilinear serifs as Georgia, which is
	a strike in favor of Palatino.  Palatino has a lower x-height
	than Georgia.

      <p>
	Standout differences at the letter level: I don't like the
	cut-off look of the Palatino c, f, p, q.  I also don't like
	the cut off Palatino j.  The Palatino x is odd at the bottom.

      <p>
	Overall: I don't much like the way the serifs are done in
	Palatino, nor the lower x-height.  They probably work okay at
	smaller font sizes.  The weight is likely something that would
	need to be evaluated in context.  I think Georgia is the
	winner here.

	The Georgia is a little wider, higher x-height, a little
	fuller, with a few more flourishes, and heavier.  I prefer the
	style of the serifs on Crimson text: they don't have the
	annoying rectilinear feel of Georgia.


      <p>
	At the letter level: the terminal of the Georgia a is way
	bigger than for Crimson text.  This is a common feature
	&ndash; true also of the terminal of the c, the terminal of
	the f, the j, and the r.  The "belly" of the Georgia a is much
	higher than for Crimson text.  That would likely make the
	Georgia a little easier to read.  The tail of the j and y in
	Georgia is longer than the tail for Crimson text.  Again, I
	think that'd make Georgia a little easier to read, although it
	also makes it a little more cluttered.  The k-l kerning in
	Georgia is wrong: they smush up against one another.

      <p>
	Overall: I think I slightly prefer Georgia.  It's worth
	looking at both at a smaller size:

      <p style="font: 14pt Georgia">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p style="font: 14pt Crimson Text">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p>
	I think it'd actually make sense to compare 14pt Georgia
	against 15 or 16pt Crimson text:

      <p style="font: 14pt Georgia">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p style="font: 16pt Crimson Text">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

      <p>
	They're really quite similar.  The Crimson text isn't quite as
	heavy.  It's also not quite as dense, which is a nice feature.
	Georgia is a little more like Times New Roman: it has that
	quality of being very dense.  That's not so good.

      <p>
	Unfortunately, it turns out that the Crimson Text caps are
	horrible, at 16pt:

      <p style="font: 16pt Crimson Text">
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	They work better at 14pt.  Let me try them also at 18pt:

      <p style="font: 18pt Crimson Text">
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	Okay, that's also dodgy.  So I think I should abandon Crimson
	text.

      <p>
	So far, the winner amongst the serif fonts is Georgia.

      <p style="font: 48pt Arial">

	On my browser+computer they are rendered identically.  They're
	not the same font, so I presume this is a deliberate choice.

	400 weight open sans:

      <p style="font: 48pt Open Sans; font-weight: 600;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	600 weight open sans:

      <p>
	Very similar.  Arial is heavier. Interesting: open sans small
	letters are wider, but caps are narrower.  I guess that would
	lessen the intrusion of the capital letters, which might be a
	good thing in body text.  Open sans is more of a humanist sans
	font &ndash; there is considerably more variation.  The
	x-height on both is very high, particularly the Airal.

      <p>
	Detailed, letter-by-letter: I like the more compact A and B of
	the open sans.  The same is true of many of the caps, in
	fact. The more closed C is better for Arial.  I'm not so keen
	necessarily on the narrow E and F for the open sans (although
	I don't like the wide E in Arial). The Arial J has a more
	rounded tail.  The Arial Q has a more natural cross.  The Open
	Sans R is much nicer.  Then Open Sans g is much more
	elaborate.  The Open Sans has a rounded dot on top of the i
	and j.

      <p>
	The 600 weight Open Sans feels more crowded than the Arial.
	Let me try looking at Arial at that weight:

      <p style="font: 48pt Arial; font-weight: 600;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	Same as before.  Let's try bolding:

      <p style="font: 48pt Arial; font-weight: bold;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	And compare to bolded Open Sans:

      <p style="font: 48pt Open Sans; font-weight: 700;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	Interesting: the differences seem less pronounced to me.  The
	dip below the baseline for Open Sans J seems annoying (and to
	some extent the Q).  The narrow E and F are a distraction.  On
	the other hand, I like the narrower B, C, D, G, K, M, P, Q.
	So that seems maybe like a small win for Open Sans.

      <p>
	Open Sans is a little more elaborate, a little more open, the
	caps are narrower (mostly a good thing, not entirely).

      <p>
	Overall, I'm probably inclined to prefer Open Sans.  Both are
	likely to be used as bold display fonts, and are quite
	similar.  I suspect that the slightly narrower caps are a
	slight win for Open Sans, and the slightly more elaborate
	nature, although it has a few annoying things.  It's still a
	relatively neutral font, although not quite as neutral as
	Arial.

	<h2>Open Sans versus Lato</h2>

      <p style="font: 48pt Open Sans;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

    <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'
	  href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,700,900' >

      <p style="font: 48pt Lato;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	I like Lato!  Better widths on B, C, E, F, and many other
	caps.  No annoying dip on the J.  In general, I think the Lato
	caps are better widths than the Open Sans widths.  There are a
	few exceptions: the D, maybe the K. But in general it's an
	improvement.  I'd prefer a higher x-height on the Lato, but
	it's still nice and high.  Lato, like Open Sans, is a little
	more elaborate than Arial (look at the g, the f, the t), but
	still very neutral.  I regret the loss of the tail on the Lato
	y.

      <p>
	Overall: a slight edge to Lato.  Let me take a look at the
	bolded versions:

      <p style="font: 48pt Open Sans; font-weight: 700;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p style="font: 48pt Lato; font-weight: 700;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	Lato looks more open and readable, while still being very
	bold.  In fact, you need to go to the 900 to get something
	similar:

      <p style="font: 48pt Lato; font-weight: 900;">
	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

      <p>
	I think I'm slightly likely to prefer that, too.

      <p>
	Verdict: a very narrow victory to Lato.  Worth trying both in
	any given situation, to see which works better.
