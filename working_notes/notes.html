      <strong>On flow version self-interruption:</strong> When
      learning to behave in new ways we constantly interrupt
      ourselves.  "That's not the right way to do it" we think.  And
      we think about how to do it in another way.

    <p>
      By contrast, when in a state of flow we are not trying to get
      better.  Rather, we are simply <em>operating</em>.  

    <p>
      There is a tension between these two ways of doing things.  My
      guess is that to get really good at something we need to spend a
      fair amount of time in both states.  Per Timothy Gallwey, I
      rather suspect that we tend to spend too much time in the
      self-interruption mode, and not enough time just operating.

      <strong>What would an out-of-control explanation look
      like?</strong> Usually when we think of explanations we think of
      something that has been designed: a documentary; a book; a
      verbal monologue.  But much of the trend around networked media
      has been for things to get less under our control.  What would
      an out-of-control explanation look like?  Does such a thing even
      make sense?

    <p>
      A partial answer is that ordinary conversation has something of
      this flavour.  A good explainer responds to the person they're
      explaining too; it becomes like a dance.  Exceptionally good
      explainers do this well even in a group.  And great explainers
      really are, sometimes, out of control: they do not know what
      will happen.

    <p>
      Can we do this technically?  I think we perhaps can.  The point
      is to set up circumstances and processes where this is likely.
