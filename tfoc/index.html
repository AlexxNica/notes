      <p>
	For much of this year (2014) I've been noodling the idea of
	running a seminar series to discuss some fun questions about
	collective intelligence, cognitive tools, and so on.

      <p>
	I'm not sure on the exact theme.  I started out with fairly
	specific ideas in mind, but recently have thought to broaden
	it out to something like "The future of computation".  It has
	the disadvantages that: (a) it's far too big a subject to
	address completely; and (b) it doesn't provide a whole lot of
	guidance to me (constraints are good!).  But on the other hand
	it is a nice big tent for some fun exploration.

      <p>
	The following document contains a few rough notes toward such
	a syllabus.  It's very telegraphic and disorganized at
	present.  It's also strongly oriented toward fundamental
	questions which I have a particular research interest in.

      <p>
	<h2>Designing cognitive tools</h2>

      <p>
	This is a strangely under-explored area.  Of course, pieces of
	it are explored by the HCI community, by the graphics
	community, by industrial designers, user interface designers,
	and so on.  But the design of cognitive tools <em>per se</em>
	seems strangely under-explored.  There is much of interest in
	a <a href="http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&q=cognitive+tools">Google
	Scholar</a> search &ndash; but less than one might think,
	given the topic.

      <p>
	<a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret Victor's work</a>,
	particularly Kill Math
	(<a href="http://mnielsen.github.io/notes/kill_math/kill_math.html">my
	notes</a>), Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction, Media for
	Thinking the Unthinkable, Learnable Programming, Inventing on
	Principle, The Future of Programming, Seeing Spaces, and Magic
	Ink.  Seymour Papert's work is a great complement, especially
	"Mindstorms".

      <p>
	Engelbart
	on <a href="http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html">Augmenting
	human intellect</a>, Bush
	on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As
	we may think</a>, Nelson
	on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_Machines">Literary
	Machines</a>.  Licklider's best known work is
	on <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html">Man-Computer
	Symbiosis</a>.  It leaves me a bit cold, though; I should
	re-read (and maybe warm up to it), or find something else.
	Alan Kay's work.  Maybe his early paper on the DynaBook?  Some
	of the recent stuff coming out of VPRI might be great to look
	at.  His history of Smalltalk is very stimulating.

      <p>
	<a href="http://rmozone.com">Robert Ochshorn's work</a>.
	Maybe Joel de Rosnay
	on <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MACRBOOK.html">The
	Macroscope</a>.  Maybe something on systems thinking.  Hard to
	say what: Donella Meadows, perhaps, or Jay Forrester?  In
	general, there is a big question here: how can we develop
	tools to let us see and navigate our entire culture?  We're at
	the beginning of doing that, not the end.  A related point: we
	know almost nothing about the cities we live.  How can we
	develop tools that reveal our own cities to us?  Yelp and
	Google Maps are a tiny, tiny start.  There might be some
	interesting stuff in the digital humanities literature.

      <p>
	Something people don't understand is that user interface
	design is an art, at least as difficult as writing an
	outstanding book or creating a great movie or painting.
	Indeed, in a sense the latter can be viewed as special cases
	of the former.  I'd like a reading that conveyed that sense.
	Better yet, maybe set a project for people to do.  It'd also
	be great to have something that conveyed just how open-ended a
	problem user interface design is, and how constrained are the
	usual ways people think about it.  Bret Victor's Magic Ink is
	a good start on this.  Maybe Don Norman's "Things that Make Us
	Smart" or "The Design of Everyday Things"?  Maybe Raskin on
	"The Humane Interface"?

      <p>
	Programming languages as user
	interfaces.  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">The
	hundred year language</a>.  What else is good on this?  Maybe
	Guy Steele's "How to Grow a Language"?  Why did programming
	language design stagnate in the 1970s?

      <p>
	<h2>Designing new forms of collective behaviour</h2>

      <p>
	The network enables us to create new forms of collective
	behaviour.  I believe that: (1) we understand almost nothing
	at all about the design of collective behaviour; and (2) it's
	possible to create processes and technologies
	which <em>dramatically</em> expand the range of possible
	collective behaviour.

      <p>
	<strong>Some examples of new modes of collective
	behaviour:</strong> Yanis
	Varoufakis's <a href="http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/why-valve-or-what-do-we-need-corporations-for-and-how-does-valves-management-structure-fit-into-todays-corporate-world/#more-252">analysis/</a>
	of Valve's unusual management model.  See also the Valve
	manual, linked from that post.  Other companies with unusual
	management models include GitHub, Gore, Mondragon (a
	collective), and Semco.

      <p>
	Open space technology (Harrison Owen) and offshoots
	(unconferences, ignite, etc). The Matlab Programming
	Competition (see Ned Gulley's papers on it).  Maybe "This is
	Burning Man".  Kasparov versus the World.  William Whyte on
	"The Organization Man".  Liquid democracy.  Other alternatives
	to democracy.  The point is to start to break down some of
	people's very constrained points of view on group process.

      <p>
	Prices and markets as enablers of collective action: I,
	Pencil.  Hayek on prices
	and <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html">The
	Use of Knowledge in Society</a>.  Adam Smith's original
	explanation of the invisible hand.  Possibly Stinchcombe's
	"When Formality Works".  Possibly Frank Pasquale's
	(forthcoming) <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674368279">The
	Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms that Control Money
	and Information</a>.  Red Plenty (with enough computing, a
	command-and-control economy may work).  How Bitcoin works.
	Mike Hearn's talks on contracts.  Dominance Assurance
	Contracts as a way of providing public goods (this could
	utterly change the world, extending markets so they can
	provide public goods).  What are the ultimate limits of
	financial instruments?  Maybe Kevin Slavin's talk about bots?
	Maybe some of the ideas people have about virtual
	corporations?  It might be nice to describe very decentralized
	protocols like Bittorrent as well.

      <p>
	The above separates out group process from financial
	instruments.  But these two things are not really separate
	from one another.  It'd be nice to have a frame to unite them.

      <p>
	<strong>Theoretical frameworks:</strong> Coase on "The Nature
	of the Firm".  Benkler on "Coase's Penguin".  Probably Eric
	Raymond as well (maybe "The Cathedral and the Bazaar").  What
	Benkler gets wrong (or doesn't see).  Ostrom's wonderful book
	"Governing the Commons" as a framework for thinking about
	collective action.  Schelling (Micromotives and
	Macrobehaviour) and Axelrod (The Evolution of Co-operation)
	and Harding (The Tragedy of the Commons) for contrast to
	Ostrom.  Lessig on "Code as Law".  It'd be good to look for
	some followups to Lessig, too.  Another possibility: Herb
	Simon on "Administrative Behaviour" (or maybe one of his other
	works).

      <p>
	<h2>Other stuff</h2>

      <p>
	Questions: What comes after the web?  How to allocate expert
	attention?  (Connect this to the work on mechanism design,
	particularly the various theorems on optimal matching).  What
	design principles should we use for cognitive tools?

      <p>
	Cory Doctorow
	on <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/01/10/lockdown.html">The
	Coming War on General-Purpose Computing</a>, especially the
	second half.  Vinge's singularity
	paper.  <a href="http://goldhaber.org">Michael Goldhaber
	on </a> <a href="http://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440">The
	Attention Economy and the Net</a> contains some stimulating
	ideas about attention as currency.  Bostrom's new book may be
	worth looking at (I haven't, yet).  Herb Simon's "The Sciences
	of the Artificial" is great framing for any discussion of the
	future of computing.  

      <p>
	I've largely ignored AI above.  That's a mistake.  It actually
	looms over the whole discussion.  At some point it'd be good
	to imagine various possible AI futures (as in Vinge's Long Now
	talk).  Which future we end up in determines a lot about the
	above.
