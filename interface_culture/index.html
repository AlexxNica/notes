	Most people don't understand user interfaces.

      <p>
	I mean this in the same way that most people don't understand
	books, or music, or movies.  They are, of course, able
	to <em>consume</em> each of these media forms.  Indeed, they
	may be quite sophisticated consumers.  But even the most
	sophisticated consumers often have no clue how
	to <em>create</em> a book or song or movie.  Many a renowned
	critic has flopped when they turned their hand to the creation
	of art.

      <p>
	I was recently at a workshop with a number of accomplished
	user interface designers.

      <p>
	Two of the striking things I learnt at the workshop were: (1)
	just how challenging it is to design a great interface; and
	(2) how poorly I understand that process.

      <p>
	Another realization, harder for me to express, is that I did
	not (and do not) fully understand just how important user
	interfaces are.  It's tempting to think of them as window
	dressing, a pretty add-on to a computer program.  But that's
	wrong.  Intuitively, I'm beginning to understand that their
	design is a very deep and fundamental part of the program.
	For instance, it makes just as much sense (maybe more) to
	speak of a breakthrough in user interface design as it does to
	speak of a breakthrough in algorithms, or data structures.

      <p>
	I wish I could express this idea better.

      <p>
	How does one become a good user interface designer?

      <p>
	Of course, I don't know.  But I suspect it's not so different
	to becoming good at writing or any other creative art, and
	that some combination of the following helps:

	<ul> 
	  <li>Do a <em>lot</em> of user interface design.  

	  <li>Design interfaces for many different types of systems.

	  <li>Do user interface redesign.  Here's an example
	  from <a href="http://worrydream.com/HowManyHouseholds/">Bret
	  Victor</a>.

	  <li>Critique is redesign lite.  So: write critiques, and in
	    general talk interfaces over with other designers.  </ul>

      <p>
	<em>Note: My title is taken from Steven
	  Johnson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interface-Culture-Steven-A-Johnson/dp/0465036805">book</a>.
	  I haven't read the book, but its title has been banging
	  around my head ever since I attended the workshop.</em>
