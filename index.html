    <a href="ebooks/index.html"><strong>My electronic library
    slideshow:</strong></a> Intended for display on my living room
    wall, as a conversation piece.  Created because I enjoy discussing
    my recent reading with visiting friends, but most of my reading is
    now done electronically, not on paper.  Note that this
    is <em>not</em> intended for casual web browsing &ndash; the 30
    second delay between frames is far too slow.

    <a href="interface_culture/index.html"><strong>Interface culture:
    working notes:</strong></a> User interface design is difficult.
    It's a rich art and craft &ndash; at least as rich as movie-making
    or writing.  Some thoughts on how to get good (do a lot, vary the
    type of system, do redesign, and do and share critiques).  The
    dichotomy between user-driven and technically-driven user
    interface design.

    <a href="working_notes/notes.html"><strong>Working
    notes:</strong></a> An early experiment in note-taking: incomplete
    notes on a few subjects.  The most interesting notion is that of
    an out-of-control explanation (as opposed to the usual controlled
    explanation).

	Kill math: notes:
      </strong></a> On new user interfaces for mathematics.  Introducing
      new fundamental (atomic) objects, operations and representations
      which we can use to think about mathematics.  Nice traditional
      example: some systems makes graphs things we can operate on, and
      treat as single objects.  Scrubabble numbers as a new type of
      number.  Moving theorems into the user interface.  The accident
      that we think of theorems as static statements.  Example Euclid:
      the Game, as a simple case where we make theorems active parts
      of the user interface.  User interfaces which cue the user.  The
      need for a flexible, expressive type system.
