      <em>Rough and incomplete working notes
      on <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret Victor's</a>
      essay <a href="http://worrydream.com/KillMath/">Kill Math</a>.
      First thoughts, so there's lots of scratching around.
      By <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org">Michael Nielsen</a>.</em>

      <p>
	Let me begin with some excerpts that explain in broad terms
	what <em>Kill Math</em> is about:
      </p>

      <blockquote><em> When most people speak of Math, what they have
	in mind is more its mechanism than its essence.  This "Math"
	consists of assigning meaning to a set of symbols, blindly
	shuffling around those symbols, and then interpreting meaning
	from the shuffled result...</em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<em>This mechanism of math evolved for a reason: it was the
	most efficient means of modeling quantitative systems given
	the constraints of pencil and paper.  Unfortunately, most
	people are not comfortable with bundling up meaning into
	abstract symbols and making them dance.  Thus, the power of
	math beyond arithmetic is generally reserved for a clergy of
	scientists and engineers... </em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<em>We are no longer constrained by pencil and paper.  The
	symbolic shuffle should no longer be taken for granted as the
	fundamental mechanism for understanding quantity and change.
	Math needs a new interface...</em>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Kill Math is my umbrella project for techniques that
	enable people to model and solve meaningful problems of
	quantity using concrete representations and intuition-guided
	exploration. In the long term, I hope to develop a
	widely-usable, insight-generating alternative to symbolic
	math...</em>
      </blockquote>

      
      <blockquote>
	<em>
	  A person should not be manually shuffling symbols [with
	  pencil and paper].  That should be done, at best, entirely
	  by software, and at least, by interactively guiding the
	  software, like playing a sliding puzzle game.  And, more
	  contentiously, I believe that a person should not have to
	  imagine the interpretation of abstract symbols.  Instead,
	  dynamic graphs, diagrams, visual models, and visual effects
	  should provide visceral representations.  Relationships
	  between values, exponential blow-ups and negligible terms,
	  should be plainly seen, not imagined...
	</em>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
	In his
	talk <a href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">Media
	For Thinking the Unthinkable</a> Victor states a closely
	related but even more ambitious program.  He quotes Richard
	Hamming's essay
	on <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Hamming.html">The
	Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics</a>:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
	<em>
	  Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot,
	  as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too
	  there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we
	  cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they
	  are, does the remark "Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot
	  think," surprise you? Evolution, so far, may possibly have
	  blocked us from being able to think in some directions;
	  there could be unthinkable
	  thoughts</em>*<span class="marginnote">* Quantum mechanics
	  is famously difficult to understand.  This is due in part to
	  unresolved conceptual problems in the foundations, which
	  make it fair to say that no-one in the world really
	  understands quantum mechanics.  I have wondered for many
	  years if the principal difficulty is that our brains aren't
	  wired the right way.  To recast this in Hamming's terms,
	  perhaps quantum mechanics only appears difficult, but is
	  actually easy to understand, provided one can think
	  "thoughts we cannot think".  Note that I'm <em>not</em>
	  saying that the trouble is merely that we're missing some
	  key theoretical idea or set of ideas.  That's the point of
	  view usually taken by people who worry about the foundations
	  of quantum mechanics.  Rather, perhaps we need to expand the
	  class of thoughts we can think in some much more radical
	  way.  An argument for this point of view is that our brains
	  evolved to understand a classical world.  Such brains might
	  perhaps come very poorly equipped to grasp a theory such as
	  quantum mechanics, which doesn't obey principles as basic as
	  local realism.

	  <br><br> Now, let me add the caveat that I believe the
	  conventional point of view is likely correct, and we simply
	  have not yet found a good but relatively conventional
	  explanation of quantum mechanics, the kind of explanation
	  which could have been understood with some work by a
	  physicist in, say, 1950, without access to special tools to
	  extend their mind.  But part of me wonders if a more radical
	  expansion of what a theory <em>is</em> may be
	  needed.</span>.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Victor points out that we have, of course, built tools
	enabling us to see wavelengths of light we cannot see, to hear
	sounds we cannot hear, and so on.  And perhaps, as the title
	of his talk suggests, it is possible that we can build tools
	to enable us to think unthinkable thoughts.
      </P>

      <p>
	These are remarkable ideas.  Of course, they are not without
	precedent.  Many people have developed related ideas,
	including William Ross Ashby, Douglas Engelbart, and Alan Kay,
	to name but a few.  But, in my opinion, Victor's development
	is unusually promising and deep.  I'm writing these notes to
	help me understand what Victor is doing, how he's doing it,
	and the most promising directions for further work.  I also
	plan to relate <em>Kill Math</em> to my own creative work, and
	hope it will help inspire some new directions in my work.
      </p>

      <p>
	The notes were more difficult to write than I expected.  In
	retrospect, I can see that while <em>Kill Math</em> is
	certainly easy to read, it is in fact very challenging to
	understand at the deeper level that would enable one to do
	similar work.  (I've made this mistake with other works,
	too.  <em>Mea culpa</em>. ) Part of the reason is that I have
	much less design and programming experience than
	Victor*<span class="marginnote" style="padding-top: 240px">*
	And, I would guess, much more mathematical research
	experience, which creates another kind of barrier to
	understanding.</span>, and the deeper I got, the more keenly I
	felt this deficit.  More on this later.
      </p>

      <p>
	Through the remainder of these notes I will use the convention
	that unmarked quotations are from <em>Kill Math</em>.  Quotes
	from other sources will be explicitly marked.  
      </p>

      <h2>Two examples: interactive difference equations and scrubbable numbers</h2>

      <p>
	To make the above ideas more concrete, let me show two of the
	examples that Victor creates.  The first is a video
	demonstrating a medium for understanding difference equations.
	The video is best watched fullscreened, which can be done by
	clicking the four-arrow icon <img src="images/vimeo.JPG"
	style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"/> in the bottom right of
	the video player: <br/>
	<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/85480838?portrait=0"

	</iframe>
	<br/> As I wrote in my essay
	<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/index.html">Reinventing
	Explanation</a>, this medium "enables many powerful
	operations, such as: tying parameters together; the
	instantaneous feedback between symbolic and graphical views of
	difference equations; and the language for searching over
	functions.  [Bret Victor has] created a vocabulary of
	operations which can be used to understand and manipulate and,
	most crucially of
	all, <em>play</em>*<span class="marginnote">* There is a
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkx1aKv2z8o">beautiful
	talk</a> by <a href="http://acko.net/about/">Stephen
	Wittens</a> where he talks about (and demonstrates) how
	powerful play can be in mathematics.  You can see this too in
	Seymour
	Papert's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms</a>.
	My experience when learning a new area of mathematics is that
	there is often a long period of time in which working with it
	is a painful slog.  The simplest things are very difficult to
	do.  But after many hours you go past some sort of threshold.
	Things begin to speed up, and it becomes very enjoyable to
	work with the objects in your new domain; you become able to
	play.  Well-designed new media may speed up this process of
	getting-to-play.</span> with difference equations.  And with
	enough exposure to this medium, we'd begin internalizing these
	operations: we'd begin to think about difference equations in
	this way."
      </p>

      <p>
	The difference equation medium is very interesting.  But it's
	easier to analyse a simpler and cruder precursor, namely,
	Victor's <a href="http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/">Scrubbing
	Calculator</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let me show the scrubbing calculator in action, solving a
	problem that would ordinarily be solved with (what we think of
	as) algebra.  You can details of the problem and its context
	in the link in the last paragraph.  The basic gist is that
	Victor asks us to consider a (real) design problem that came
	up when he was designing the graphics in a book.  The design
	problem was to figure out how large to make the height of the
	bars in a bar chart, in order that the chart fill up the
	available space.  The size (768 px) of the available space as
	well as the margins (63px and 140px) and the gaps between bars
	(20px) were already known, but could be slightly adjusted if
	necessary.  This problem is, of course, easily solved using
	algebra.  Click on the play button below to see a
	demonstration of a different approach:
      </p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
    	function playVideo (name) {
    		var div = document.getElementById(name);
    		div.style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
    		div.style.cursor = "default";
    		div.getElementsByTagName("img")[0].style.display = "none";
    		div.getElementsByTagName("img")[1].style.display = "none";
    		var video = document.getElementById("v" + name);
    		video.play();
    	}

    	function videoEnded (name) {
    		var div = document.getElementById(name);
    		div.getElementsByTagName("img")[1].style.display = "block";
    		div.style.cursor = "pointer";
    	}
      </script>
      <!-- From http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/, with minor changes -->
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-left:40px;">
	<div id="b" class="videoOverlay" 
	     style="left:-60px; width:700px; height:52px;" 
	     onclick="playVideo('b');">
	  <img style="left:333px; top:0px;" 
	       src="Images/ClickToPlay.png" 
	       width="54" height="56">
	  <img style="left:333px;top:0px; display:none;" 
	       src="Images/ClickToReplay.png" 
	       width="42" height="66">
	</div>
	<video id="vb" width="616" height="52" preload onended="videoEnded('b');">
	  <source type="video/quicktime"
		  src="Movies/BarAdjust.mov">
	    <source type="video/webm" 
		    src="Movies/BarAdjust.webm">
	</video>
      </div>

      <p>
	What's going on is perhaps already obvious from the earlier
	video, but just to spell it out: he's typing in his existing
	constraints on the margins and gap, and making a guess for the
	bar height.  Then he scrubs over the value for the bar height
	until the answer on the right is what he wants, perhaps with
	some minor adjustments to other quantities.
      </p>

      <p>
	Here's another example, which illustrates some different
	ideas.  In this case, Victor is using the scrubbing calculator
	to split the bill for a road trip.  His friend Andy paid 2910
	dollars during the trip, while he (Bret Victor) paid 426
	dollars.  How much money does he owe his friend, in order that
	the bill is split evenly?  To solve the problem, Victor
	"connects" two quantities in the equations, so they are tied
	together:
      </p>

      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-left:40px;">
	<div id="c" class="videoOverlay" 
	     style="left:-60px; width:600px; height:70px;" 
	     onclick="playVideo('c');">
	  <img style="left:333px;top:0px;" 
	       src="Images/ClickToPlay.png" 
	       width="54" height="56">
	  <img style="left:333px;top:0px;display:none;" 
	       src="Images/ClickToReplay.png" width="42" height="66">
	</div>
	<video id="vc" width="442" height="82" preload onended="videoEnded('c');">
	  <source src="Movies/TripConnect.mov" type="video/quicktime">
	    <source src="Movies/TripConnect.webm" type="video/webm">
	</video>
      </div>

      <p>There is more in
	the <a href="http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/">essay</a>:
	Victor also adds operations to "lock" and "unlock" numbers in
	the equations.  I won't discuss those operations here, since
	we've already got quite a bit to be thinking about.  But those
	operations are interesting, too.

      <p>
	What should we make of these kinds of examples?
      </p>

      <p>
	As someone mathematically trained it's tempting to reflexively
	respond: "That seems harder than solving the relevant
	equations."  That's true if you've already spent a great deal
	of time mastering traditional techniques for solving such
	equations.  However, that's an unfair comparison, and it's not
	clear whether someone learning this for the first time would
	have more trouble with algebra or with learning the scrubbing
	calculator.  I suspect that many would find the scrubbing
	calculator easier, and some people would find it far easier.
	There's an old joke in which a mathematics professor begins
	posing a problem: "Suppose $x$ is equal to $15$...", only to
	be interrupted by a student: "But professor, what if $x$ is
	not equal to $15$?"  My own experience in talking about
	mathematics with others is that there are many intelligent
	people with exactly this kind of block.  And when someone is
	blocked in this way it's very difficult for them to really
	understand what's going on when manipulating algebraic
	expressions.

      <p>
	Another typical of skeptical response to the scrubbing
	calculator is to emphasize the <em>value</em> in learning to
	use the abstract symbols.  Of course, there is great value in
	that, but it's an exceptionally poor basis for comparison.
	The value in the traditional approach is only gradually
	revealed over years of mathematical training.  We should not
	expect to understand the value of the scrubbing calculator all
	at once, in our first reflexive response.  We would need to
	develop the ideas in the scrubbing calculator much further in
	order to understand the value in this alternative
	approach*<span class="marginnote">* Much of the online
	commentary directed at <em>Kill Math</em> completely misses
	this point.  You have people enumerating all the great things
	about traditional analytic methods.  Many of those people have
	trained for years (or decades) with those analytic techniques,
	yet have only a few minutes exposure to these alternative
	techniques.  For many examples of this style of commentary,
	see the
	comments <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2011/bret-victors-kill-math-project/">here</a>.
	Of course, detailed criticisms in this vein may be useful as a
	way of
	<em>improving</em> the medium (see,
	e.g., <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/dont-kill-math.html">Evan
	Miller's stimulating critique</a>) , but they have little
	value as a means of evaluating the potential of the medium,
	which is often the intent.<br>

        (Incidentally, this erroneous approach to evaluating the
	potential of anything new is so common, across so many fields,
	that I wonder if it shouldn't be regarded as a cognitive bias,
	along the lines of things like confirmation bias and the
	fundamental attribution error. ) </span>.  In essence, we're
	comparing a few minutes exposure to a medium developed by one
	person with thousands of hours of training in a tradition that
	has been developed over thousands of years by thousands of
	people.  It's perhaps not so surprising that the latter has
	some advantages!  But those advantages are irrelevant for the
	purposes of making a comparison.  It's like trying to
	understand cubism's potential to transform how we see merely
	by looking at Braque's first cubist paintings:

	<img src="Images/Braque.JPG">

      <p>
	What makes the scrubbing calculator seem remarkable to me is
	that it develops <em>new atomic operations</em> which we can
	use to think about mathematics.  I've shown two such
	operations: the basic scrubbing operation, and the
	"connection" operation.  We also saw several such operations
	with the difference equation medium, e.g., the act of
	searching over an expression.  More subtly, the notion
	of <em>instantaneously</em> graphing an expression is, I
	believe, a new basic operation; it changes the experience of
	mathematics.

      <p>
	In the case of the scrubbing calculator these atomic
	operations are introduced as a means to a particular end,
	namely allowing people to solve algebraic problems while
	working with concrete numbers:

      <blockquote><em> This work is about allowing people to solve
	algebraic problems while working entirely with concrete
	numbers, instead of abstract symbols.  We are accustomed to
	assuming that variables must be symbols.  But this isn't true
	&mdash; a variable is simply a number that varies.  If we are
	able to vary numbers interactively, then we don't necessarily
	need to name them... We conventionally use rote algebraic
	mechanisms to convert the equation into an explicit
	expression.  <strong>But this is not paper</strong>, and a
	computer has no trouble calcuating an implicitly-defined
	number... [We also] use $x$ to mean, "There is a single number
	that should appear in two different places"... <strong>But
	this is not paper</strong>, and a computer has no trouble
	keeping track of multiple instances of an object.  With a
	calculator like this one, we can connect numbers to make them
	the same, instead of having to name them.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	This passage emphasizes rather explicitly how the computer
	enables new atomic operations.  It strikes me that although
	these atomic operations were introduced in response to a
	specific problem, they can potentially be repurposed and used
	to serve other ends.  In other words, we can take these new
	atomic operations and try them out in new contexts, trying to
	push them as far as they can go.  The most powerful will, no
	doubt, turn out to be extremely useful in a wide variety of
	contexts*<span class="marginnote">* There's a related
	phenomenon in mathematics: surprisingly often, famous results
	began life as lemmas in papers whose "main" result was some
	now largely forgotten theorem.  Instead, it was the lemma,
	originally just waystation along the way to proving the
	theorem, which was found to be of utility in many other
	contexts.  You might ask: why not just aim at the lemma?  I'm
	not sure it can be done.  The utility of such lemmas is
	usually that they can help solve a wide variety of hard
	problems.  And so it is natural that they are first
	discovered <em>en route</em> to solving a specific hard
	problem.  Absent such problems, I don't know that it's easy to
	determine which tools will be most powerful. </span>.
      </P>

      <p>
	Everyone who learns mathematics understands that how we think
	is strongly influenced by the elementary operations and
	representations available to us.  Think of how decimal
	notation enables us to reason in much more powerful ways than
	roman numerals.  Or about how the invention of co-ordinates
	made possible a new approach to geometry.  Much of the history
	of mathematics has been about expansions in our reasoning
	power enabled by the invention of new mathematical objects,
	and by the invention of new ways of representing and operating
	on mathematical objects.

      <p>
	Historically, those representations and operations have been
	constrained by the accident that we're using paper and pencil
	as our medium.  Changing the medium enables an expansion of
	those representations and operations:

      <img src="Images/expansion.png">

      <p>
	Representations like the scrubbable numbers and operations
	like connecting two numbers are examples of this expansion.
	But, of course, there's no more reason for them to be an
	endpoint than there was
	for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals">Babylonian
	numerals</a>.

      <p>
	One problem with the diagram above is that it conveys a
	monolithic impression of what a computer is.  Namely, a
	computer is either: (a) a thing with a qwerty keyboard, a
	mouse, a flat LCD monitor about 20-30 inches in linear
	dimension; or (b) a flat device, about 4-10 inches in linear
	dimension, with a touchscreen which you manipulate by tapping
	and swiping.  Of course, it's a historical accident that these
	are the dominant modes of interaction right now, and it will
	certainly not remain true in the future.  It's interesting to
	ask questions like: what new representations and operations
	become possible when you're using a kinect?  A wii remote?  A
	leapmotion device?  An Oculus?  You can ask questions like:
	how would you interact with your voice?  With your eyes (using
	eye-tracking and similar tools)?  With motions of your body?
	I suspect that even taking a silly question seriously &ndash;
	say, what kinds of interaction can you do with your elbow
	&ndash; may be enlightening.  And, of course, you can turn it
	around, and ask questions like: what hardware and interface
	would let us best explain general relativity?  Or molecular
	biology?  Or quantum mechanics*<span class="marginnote">* Had
	this question been seriously asked in 1970 I suspect quantum
	computers would have been invented earlier.  Feynman's
	pioneering 1982 paper on quantum computing started from a
	related question, namely: what kind of computer would you need
	to use to <em>simulate</em> physics?</span>?

      <h2>Scrubbable numbers over many levels of granularity</h2>

      <p>
	At the end of
	Victor's <a href="http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/">essay</a>
	on the scrubbing calculator, he poses the following exercise:

      <blockquote>
	<em><strong>Granularity.</strong> Some numbers need to be
	adjusted over large ranges &mdash; you may want to go
	thousands in one stroke. Other numbers might need multiple
	decimal-point precision. The tool can't necessarily infer
	which is which. Can you think of a UI that could accomodate
	adjustments at different levels of granularity?</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Here's the outcome of my first set of attempts at this
	exercise.  Mouseover either number on the left of the equation
	below, click on one of the revealed icons, and adjust the
	number.

      <div class="equation">
	<scrubbable-number id="n1">21</scrubbable-number> +
	<scrubbable-number id="n2">47</scrubbable-number> =
	<span id="answer" class="ans">68</span>
      </div>
      <script src="scrubbable.js"></script>

      <p>
	This gives us more flexibility than the original scrubbable
	numbers, because we have the ability to adjust numbers both
	linearly and exponentially.  However, it has a number of
	deficiencies.
      </p>

      <p>
	Some of the deficiencies are relatively minor problems with
	the look and feel, including: (1) the expansion and
	contraction of the scrubbable numbers causes distracting
	changes to the overall layout of the equation, and would
	perhaps work better if the icons were <em>below</em> rather
	than alongside the numbers; (2) the icons need to be more
	responsive, perhaps changing in more obvious way to indicate
	they've been selected, and the colour choices could do with
	more work; (3) there are some inconsistencies in the way
	highlighting is done that should be ironed out.  It's easy to
	make progress on these and other problems with just a little
	more work.

      <p>
	However, one really serious deficiency is that this approach
	severely limits the class of numbers you can reach.  To see
	the issue, suppose you use the exponential slider to increase
	a number out to near (say) 1 billion.  Then each increment of
	the slider moves you by an amount of about 100 million.  You
	can use neither the exponential nor the linear slider to
	adjust over that entire range.  And so many numbers are
	essentially inaccessible.

      <p>
	I'm somewhat embarassed to say that I didn't anticipate this
	difficulty in advance.  In a backhanded way, that's
	encouraging: this new representation made a
	problem <em>obvious</em> which I didn't see initially, despite
	having spent hundreds of hours of my life thinking about
	exponential versus linear growth!

      <p>
	Can we do better?  In the equation below, click and hold on
	one of the numbers on the left-hand side, and then slowly drag
	the mouse quite a ways to the right (or left), while
	continuing to hold down the button.  Then repeat the process a
	few times, to get a feel for what's going on.  Note that for
	this particular problem, we don't actually need to explore
	over many orders of magnitude, and so this approach is
	overkill.  Still, it's a context that's familiar from Victor's
	example above.

      <div class="equation">
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_1">60</scrubbable-number2> top margin +
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_2">140</scrubbable-number2> bottom margin +
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_3">8</scrubbable-number2> x
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_4">20</scrubbable-number2> gap +
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_5">9</scrubbable-number2> x
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n2_6">100</scrubbable-number2> bar height
	= <span id="answer2" class="ans">1260</span>
      </div>
      <script src="scrubbable2.js"></script>

      <p>
	A little experimentation will show that scrubbing here has a
	nonlinear response.  When you're near the number, it changes
	by a small amount.  As you get further away, it starts to
	change by larger and larger amounts.  This allows both very
	small and very large (albeit coarse) adjustments.  The
	advantage, though, is that by making a few adjustments we can
	reach an arbitrary number.  In essence, we begin our
	exploration by finding the right order of magnitude, and the
	most significant digit, then explore to find the second most
	significant digit, and so on.
      </P>

      <p>
	Of course, there are still many deficiencies.  The design
	could do more to unobtrusively cue the user as to the expected
	behaviour.  We have limited range of motion on the left, which
	makes decreasing numbers somewhat awkward.  I explored several
	response functions, and this worked the best on my machine
	(with its particular setup of mouse and screen resolution).
	However, I wouldn't be surprised if a thorough systematic
	investigation of response functions resulted in a better
	response function.

      <p>
	More seriously, the above demonstration has the problem that
	the context is wrong.  When doing this kind of design work we
	don't need to explore over many orders of magnitude; it's the
	wrong tool for the problem.  Let's look briefly at a better
	problem.

      <p>
	It's a problem about world population.  Let's assume that
	world population growth is 1 percent per year, and we're
	interested in knowing: what does the population need to be in
	order that in 20 years time the population will pass 10
	billion?  This problem <em>is</em> a little artifical, but
	we'll still learn some useful things by considering it.  Try
	scrubbing over the first number in the following equation:

      <div class="equation">
	<scrubbable-number2 id="n3">7000000000</scrubbable-number2> people
	x 1 % growth rate for 20 years
	= <span id="answer3" class="ans">...</span>
      </div>

      <p>
	Some experimentation suggests that it might make sense to give
	the slider some <em>memory</em>. In particular, the natural
	way to explore is first to get the overall order of magnitude
	about right, then to explore one or two orders of magnitude
	lower, then one or two orders of magnitude lower, and so on.

      <p>
	Another natural idea to explore is allowing the growth rate to
	be scrubbable. A challenge here is that the natural way to
	scrub the growth rate involves only a linear response (the
	same is true for the "20 years" term).  It'd perhaps make
	sense to cue the user to the difference between numbers
	needing a linear versus a nonlinear response.  How could we do
	that in a natural way?

      <p>
	In my first experiments with the above, I wrote the growth
	rate as $1.01$ per year.  A challenge in scrubbing such
	numbers is that we both want to be able to
	increase <em>and</em> decrease the scale of the scrubbing.  
	How could that be achieved? 

      <p>
	I won't try to address all these questions here.  Still, it's
	obviously fertile ground for exploration, and might be fun to
	come back to.

      <h2>Comparison to <em>Mathematica</em> and other existing systems</h2>

      <p>
	How do the ideas in <em>Kill Math</em> relate to systems such
	as <em>Mathematica</em>, <em>Maple</em>, <em>Matlab</em>, and
	so on?  

      <p>
	A skeptic may, for instance, respond to <em>Kill Math</em>
	with: doesn't <em>Mathematica</em> (or some other such system)
	already offer a new interface to mathematics?
	Isn't <em>Mathematica</em> tremendously useful?  Shouldn't we
	focus our efforts on this kind of system, or open source
	alternatives such as <em>Sage</em>?

      <p>
	Let me begin by pointing out the obvious, so I don't lose
	sight of it*<span class="marginnote">* This perhaps seems
	superfluous, but I find I often lose sight of the obvious when
	I get confused, as inevitably happens.</span>:
	of <em>course</em> the ideas in <em>Kill Math</em> are
	radically different than in the other systems.  This is
	immediately evident upon simply looking at the prototypes.
	The problem is to understand and articulate what the
	differences are, and what is new in <em>Kill Math</em>.

      <p>
	For concreteness I will begin my analysis by
	comparing <em>Kill Math</em> to just one
	system, <em>Mathematica</em>.  Then I'll turn to other
	systems.

      <p>
	<em>Mathematica</em> is certainly tremendously useful.  But
	that doesn't mean it's doing the same thing as the prototypes
	in <em>Kill Math</em>.  Consider the type of problems
	typically solved by <em>Mathematica</em>.  Amongst the most
	common are:

      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li> Integrating an expression.

	  <li> Solving a set of equations.

	  <li> Simplifying an expression.

	  <li> Substituting a value into an expression.
	</ul>

      <p>
	What is new here, compared to 19th century mathematics, is
	that: (a) the solution to the problems is automated, and can
	be done with no (or little) human intervention; and (b)
	the <em>scale</em> at which these activities can be carried
	out &ndash; it is not uncommon to use <em>Mathematica</em> to
	deal with expressions involving thousands of terms.  Both
	these abilities qualitatively change how people engage with
	mathematics, dramatically enlarging both the class of problems
	they're willing to attack, and the class of problems they're
	able to solve.
      </p>

      <p>
	However, note that each problem in my list above is of a type
	that would have been familiar to 19th century mathematicians,
	the data specifying the problem is given in a form that would
	have been familiar to 19th century mathematicians, and the
	solution to the problem is given in a form that would have
	been familiar to 19th century mathematicians.
      </p>

      <p>
	In these senses, <em>Mathematica</em> doesn't change what we
	think mathematics <em>is</em>.  Many of the core objects and
	operations would have been familiar to a 19th century
	mathematician.
      </p>

      <p>
	Are there any ways in which <em>Mathematica</em> does change
	what we think mathematics is?  Well, <em>Mathematica</em> does
	introduce several new fundamental objects and operations into
	mathematics.  In particular, graphs, animations, and notebooks
	are all new fundamental objects*<span class="marginnote">* Or
	nearly so.  What I mean by fundamental object is that the
	object should have, at the least, a reasonably powerful
	interface allowing it to be inspected, manipulated, and
	related to other fundamental objects.  This is true, with some
	qualifications, for graphs, animations, and notebooks
	in <em>Mathematica</em>.</span>, with associated fundamental
	operations.  Of course, things like graphs and notebooks (less
	so animations) have long been part of mathematics.  But the
	benefit in <em>Mathematica</em> is that we
	can <em>operate</em> on them, that is, we can perform
	programmatic operations involving graphs, animations, and
	notebooks.  Put another way, we can treat these
	as <em>things</em> in a way this is not possible with paper
	and pencil.  On paper, a graph is a tremendously complex
	aggregate typically involving hundreds of strokes of the pen.
	On a computer it may be treated as a single object which can
	be manipulated in powerful ways using single commands.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Ideally, these new objects will be data structures with a
	beautiful, clean, and powerful interface, one that integrates
	well with the rest of <em>Mathematica</em>, and makes it
	possible to programmatically reason about these objects.  For
	instance, with a well-designed interface it ought to be
	trivial to say things like: plot this graph over many random
	choices of such-and-such parameters, and find the version of
	the graph which shows the greatest divergence in behaviour
	between these two quantities of interest.  Or to say: contrast
	the complexity of underlying reasoning used in two different
	notebooks (say, two different proofs of the same theorem).  Or
	to say: pipe the output from these two notebooks into this
	other notebook.  And so on.  Broadly speaking, as designers of
	such a system we want to ask questions like: <em>What new
	classes of object can we introduce?</em> <em>What are powerful
	operations that could be performed on these objects?</em>
	And: <em>Are there powerful new data structures we can build
	from these objects (and associated operations on those data
	structures)?</em>  When we do this we make it possible to
	think in powerful ways about these new objects.  We are, in a
	real way, enlarging the space of thoughts we can
	think*<span class="marginnote">* Incidentally, there is
	another class of new objects added in <em>Mathematica</em>,
	beyond notebooks, graphs, and animations.  That's <em>very
	large expressions</em>.  100 years ago it was not practical
	for a mathematician to deal with an expression involving
	10,000 terms, unless there was some regularity that enabled
	them to deal with many terms at once.  Certainly, one couldn't
	treat such an expression as a single object which can be
	manipulated in powerful ways.  Nowadays, it is routine to deal
	with such expressions, and there are powerful operations which
	can be performed with such expressions; there is a real sense
	in which we can now think about such expressions, when
	formerly we could not.  This is another example of enlarging
	the space of thoughts we can think.</span>.
      </P>

      <p>
	Now, I'm not a <em>Mathematica</em> guru, but my impression is
	that the ideal described in the last paragraph isn't quite
	what's happened.  Many of these things are in principle
	possible in <em>Mathematica</em>.  But that doesn't mean they
	are always easy and natural.  For example, you'd like for it
	to be trivially easy to inspect, manipulate and reason about
	the contents of <em>Mathematica</em> notebooks, having
	powerful tools to access things like the parse trees and the
	chains of transformation rules used by <em>Mathematica</em> to
	solve problems.  That may well be possible &ndash; I don't
	know enough about <em>Mathematica</em> to be sure.  But my
	experience with <em>Mathematica</em> suggests that it's
	certainly not what the system was designed to do.  With that
	said, the system has gradually evolved in this direction, with
	these new objects and operations gradually becoming more
	powerful, and moving toward becoming first class mathematical
	citizens.  However, it does not appear to have been a high
	priority to push the design of those new objects and
	operations, nor to make them central to the system.
      </p>

      <p>
	To some extent, <em>Mathematica</em> looks to me like what you
	get when a very competent and creative traditionally trained
	mathematician*<span class="marginnote">* Wolfram's PhD was, in
	fact, in theoretical physics. For my current purposes, though,
	the difference doesn't much matter.  (Indeed, there's a lot of
	overlap between the two in training).</span> designs a system
	for doing mathematics.  The problems it solved, at least in
	early versions, are exactly the type of problems that
	competent and creative mathematicians have been interested in
	for decades or centuries.  And so the mathematics started out
	represented in very conventional ways.  The system has only
	gradually added new fundamental classes of object and
	operation.
      </p>

      <p>
	By contrast, the prototypes in <em>Kill Math</em> look to me
	like what you get when a very competent and creative designer
	starts designing systems for doing mathematics.  What's at
	issue is, in fact, the fundamental objects, operations and
	representations that we have.  Think about some of the
	operations introduced in the prototypes above:
      </P>

      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li> The operation of "tying" two quantities together, to
	  form a single linked entity.
	    
	  <li> The operation of scrubbing a number.

	  <li> The operation of "searching" over the graph.

	  <li> ...
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
	These operations are, in turn, associated to new fundamental
	objects, such as tied numbers, and search expressions for the
	graph, as well as redefining the way we think about old
	objects: a scrubbable number is <em>not</em> the same as an
	ordinary number, in important ways.  In particular, scrubbing
	enables new kinds of exploration and play.  That may sound
	like an exaggeration, and perhaps it is when we're dealing
	with very simple prototypes, but as the prototypes become more
	sophisticated I this it makes more and more sense to think of
	scrubbable numbers as truly a different type of object.
	Imagine you are playing a first-person shooter game, but
	instead of directly controlling the motion, you instead
	repeatedly have to type in an angle describing the direction
	you're facing.  This would change your relationship to the
	character, and not just in the obvious sense that it would
	slow down the rate at which you could control the character;
	it would change the sense of control, and give you much less
	visceral feedback.  Scrubbable numbers point the way toward
	a different relationship with numbers.

      <p>
	This sounds very wishy-washy and touchy-feely.  Yet I think
	it's at the heart of what it means to understood
	something. Littlewood is supposed*<span class="marginnote">*
	The story is amusing. Littlewood was reading the proofs of
	some remarks by Hardy on Ramanujan: "as someone said, each of
	the positive integers [etc]".  Littlewood responded: "I
	wondered who said that; I wish I had".  In the final version
	it read "it was Littlewood who said...".  There is more to the
	story, which is told in Littlewood's
	beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician's_Miscellany">Miscellany</a>.</span>
	to have remarked that "every positive integer is one of
	Ramanjuan's personal friends".  That's a statement about the
	relationship Ramanujan had with the integers.
	

      <p>
	Returning to <em>Kill Math</em>, and to sum up, where it
	differs from <em>Mathematica</em> is in focussing on
	identifying new types of mathematical object, new
	representations (both for new and old objects), and new
	operations (again, both for new and old objects).  All this
	happens to some extent in <em>Mathematica</em>, but it is not
	the design goal in the same way as in <em>Kill Math</em>.
	Rather, I believe <em>Mathematica</em>'s core focus is
	on <em>outsourcing cognition</em>: doing the kind of cognitive
	tasks mathematicians have always done, but much faster, and
	more reliably.  The expansion of what mathematics is is a more
	incidental goal.  Both goals are, of course, very
	worthwhile; <em>Mathematica</em> (and systems like it) are,
	for the time being, much more mature.  It is interesting to
	consider the possibility of some future system

      <p>
	<strong>A parenthetical remark on notebooks:</strong> The
	notebooks are interesting as a new way to represent and
	experience a collection of mathematical ideas.  A nice example
	to convey the flavour comes from this
	<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Economics.ipynb">iPython
	notebook</a> by Peter Norvig.  It's in Python, but similar
	things can be done with <em>Mathematica</em> notebooks.  The
	link takes you to a static web version of the notebook, but
	the important thing is that you can download the notebook and
	execute it.  When you do that, what the notebook offers is
	an <em>experience</em> of certain important mathematical
	ideas.  Another person can go in and begin to tweak and extend
	and even transform the ideas Norvig is expressing.  So the
	notebook provides a vivid demonstration of counter-intuitive
	results, which can provoke questions, and provide a relatively
	easy way for a person to then answer those questions.  In
	other words, it's creating a genuine experience of non-trivial
	mathematical ideas; an experience of being able
	to <em>play</em> with them, in the terminology I used earlier.
	That's something that only a tiny fraction of the population
	have ever experienced.  Now, a similar experience could have
	been created with 19th century tools.  But it would have been
	pretty darn difficult to achieve, and hard to scale the
	experience.  With <em>Mathematica</em> or a tool like ipython
	it becomes much easier.  It's not yet trivial, though, since
	while playing with short Python scripts is easier than
	conventional mathematical modelling, it's still a relatively
	difficult intellectual activity.
      </p>


      <p>
	<strong>What about systems other
	than <em>Mathematica</em></strong>?  I have only a little
	experience with systems such
	as <em>Matlab</em>, <em>Maple</em>, and <em>Sage</em>.  My
	impression is that many of my remarks
	about <em>Mathematica</em> apply to those as well.  In
	particular, many of the core objects and operations in those
	systems are objects and operations well understood by 19th
	century mathematicians.  New objects and operations have been
	added, but it's mostly been done piecemeal, in a rather
	gradual fashion, in a manner similar to that I described
	for <em>Mathematica</em>.  Again, it does not appear to have
	been a high priority to push the design of those new objects
	and operations, nor to make them central to the system.  
      </p>

      <p>
	There are, of course, many systems for exploring mathematics
	that I haven't listed above.  Think of Coq, Wolfram Alpha, D3,
	R, Julia, Prolog, Logo, Scratch, Haskell, and others.  All of
	these are, in their own ways, different to both <em>Kill
	Math</em> and <em>Mathematica</em>*<span class="marginnote">*
	Wolfram Alpha is an extension of <em>Mathematica</em>, but is
	fundamentally different in enough ways that it requires a
	separate analysis.  The same seems likely to be true of
	Wolfram's new programming language, which I have not yet
	looked at in any detail.</span>, and require their own
	analyses.  I am not yet sufficiently familiar with these
	systems that I'll attempt a detailed commentary. I will,
	however, note that these systems also add new first-class
	objects and operations.  In particular, they reify data sets
	and proofs: these become things that can be inspected,
	manipulated, and related to other objects.  However, I do not
	know to what extent this sort of extension is the raison
	d'être of these systems, and to what extent it's simply an an
	unintended consequence of other design decisions.

      <h2>Moving theorems into the user interface</h2>

      
      <p>
	Theorems express surprising connections between mathematical
	concepts.  Think of the way the fundamental theorem of
	arithmetic connects the positive integers to the primes.  Or
	the way the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality connects inner products
	and lengths.  The information the Sylow theorems give us about
	the size of subgroups of a finite group.  The fundamental
	theorem of algebra tells us that there is a root for every
	non-trivial polynomial over the complex numbers (or,
	equivalently, that such a polynomial can be factored into
	monomials).  And so on.  Ideally, such connections should
	be <em>made visible</em> through the user interface.  That is
	we should <em>move theorems into the user interface</em>.
	Tipping it upside down, we can view theorems as challenges to
	develop a user interface which reifies those theorems in a
	powerful way, providing the user with cues that help them
	reason, and representing mathematical objects in ways that
	help suggest the relationships they obey.

      <p>
	Knuth <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2318994">once
	said</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>I have been impressed by numerous instances of
	mathematical theories that are really about particular
	algorithms; these theories are typically formulated in
	mathematical terms that are much more cumbersome and less
	natural than the equivalent formulation today's computer
	scientists would use.</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	We can go much further.  Theorems are traditionally presented
	as static statements about the relationship between
	mathematical objects.  But the static nature of such theorems
	is a consequence of historical accidents about the media we've
	used to represent mathematics, not of the fundamental nature
	of mathematics.  We could equally well have theorems which are
	actively reified in the environments in which we think; they
	respond to what we do, they cue us when needed.  That is,
	they're visible, active parts of the mathematical process.

      <p>
	Let me give an example that at least starts to hint at what
	I'm suggesting.  It's not what we'd usually call a
	theorem*<span class="marginnote">* I'm really using the word
	"theorem" as shorthand for "non-trivial mathematical
	connection".</span>, but it's a very simple example of the
	sort of connection often made in theorems.  It illustrates how
	the value of $\sin(\theta)$ is just the $y$ co-ordinate for a
	point on a unit circle at an angle $\theta$ from the
	horizontal axis.  Try clicking and dragging to adjust the
	angle on either side of the frame.  Or click "Start" to see
	how the behaviour changes as $\theta$
	changes*<span class="marginnote">* This design is not mine,
	nor do I know where the idea originated (I have seen
	variations on this idea many times, in slightly different
	formats).</span>.

		style="display: none">Stop</button>

      <canvas id="sine" height="200" width="600"></canvas>
      <script src="sine.js"></script>

      <p>
	As I said above, this starts to hint at what I'm talking
	about.  It does provide a nice, concrete illustration of a
	fact that many students don't pick up on.  One shortcoming is
	that it's about <em>explanation</em>, not <em>discovery</em>.
	Explanation is valuable, but it's also a much less challenging
	context than discovery.  When you're doing discovery <em>you
	don't know what results to apply</em>.

      <p>
	To unpack that a bit further, let me discuss another fun
	example:
	<a href="http://euclidthegame.org/">Euclid: The Game</a>.  In
	level 1 of the game, the player is presented with two points,
	A and B, shown below:
	
	<img src="Images/euclid_1.jpg">

      <p> They are asked to use five tools &ndash; the five icons on
	the top left &ndash; to construct an equilateral triangle.
	The tools do things like inserting a line segment, or
	constructing a circle with a specified center and specified
	edge point (which could be, for example, points A and B).  By
	using those tools appropriately we can construct an
	equilateral triangle.

      <p>
	Marvellous!  We now know something new: we've learnt how to
	use those elementary tools to construct an equilateral
	triangle.  Here's the next level of the game:
      <p>

	If you look closely, you'll see that there is a new icon in
	the top row, representing our ability to construct an
	equilateral triangle.  We're growing a user interface, moving
	the mathematical relationships we discover into that
	interface.  And as a result we can <em>see what we know</em>
	about different mathematical objects.

      <p>
	This is a nice idea, but has many shortcomings as implemented.
	In the game as shown, the capabilities we add are relatively
	opaque.  A user can click around for a while, get lucky, and
	add an extra tool into their geometric kit.  They do not
	necessarily understand why what they did worked.  Oftentimes
	it's that understanding which is really valuable, and which we
	most want people to internalize.  But that process of
	understanding is <em>not</em> *<span class="marginnote">* It
	might be possible to improve the process of understanding by
	turning the game into <em>Euclid Golf</em>: challenge people
	to find constructions that are the <em>simplest possible</em>
	(e.g., required least effort, in some natural metric).  The
	requirement of minimizing the constructions will tend to
	increase understanding, as people take their initial,
	imperfect solutions, and try to understand what is essential,
	and what is cruft that can be eliminated.  I'm not sure this
	would work: many of the "random" solutions that people are
	producing are already minimal or near-minimal.  But maybe
	there's the seed of an idea here.  Might be a nice future
	project.</span> not what's emphasized in the current game.

      <p>
	Another problem is that we know so much.  Think of all the
	different geometric constructions that we know.  How could we
	fit all those thousands of constructions in a natural way into
	a user interface?  Without some clever ideas the interface is
	going to be too confusing to be useful. 

      <p>
	This problem arises also in other contexts.  Imagine now that
	we're working on some mathematical problem, and we write down
	$n$ to denote a positive integer.  In an ideal mathematical
	super-notebook, we'd potentially see $n$ in many different
	ways. For instance, perhaps the most famous representation is
	that every such integer is a unique product of
	primes*<span class="marginnote">* Note, by the way, that I'm
	not saying that when you write down an integer &mdash; say, 91
	&mdash; you should be able to see its prime factorization (7 x
	13).  I'm speaking more abstractly: every integer $n$ has a
	unique prime factorization $p_1^{m_1} p_2^{m_2} \ldots
	p_k^{m_k}$.  We should easily be able to reason about these
	alternate representations.</span>.  But it's just one of
	thousands of representations known for positive integers.
	Which representations are relevant?  
	
      <p>
	The art of mathematics is very often in choosing which
	representation to apply in order to obtain insight.  A good
	mathematician internalizes many different representations,
	understands how they relate to one another, in what contexts
	they tend to be applied, and how.  A good user interface would
	reflect this plethora of possibilities, and help hint or cue
	you to use the right representation at the right time.  This
	is what I was referring to above when I said that explanation
	is a much less challenging context than discovery.  When
	you're doing the kind of exploration that leads to discovery
	you don't necessarily know what results to apply.  Thus, it
	seems to me to be a much easier problem to design user
	interfaces for explanation than for discovery.

      <p>
	So I don't immediately see how to design a user interface for
	discovery.  I've made a few initial on-paper attempts, working
	naively, and they have not worked so well.  I may recount this
	in future notes &ndash; it's worth thinking about what went
	wrong.  Certainly, this is a problem deserving sustained
	effort!  I will make three comments that occurred to me while
	working, however.

      <p>
	First, in terms of the richness of the user interface needed
	to do discovery: there may be a considerable advantage to
	using a 3d environment, like that provided by the Oculus Rift.
	I expect that having 3 spatial dimensions will make it
	possible for designers to create interfaces that make it
	possible for users to work in a far richer and more complex
	choice environment than is currently the case; enough to make
	a dramatic qualitative change in the experience.

      <p>
	Second, I proceeded by picking a piece of simple but genuine
	mathematics where it's possible to give a plausible account of
	discovery.  I found that having an existing narrative of
	discovery helped in stimulating user interface ideas.  My
	initial experiments were with the main result from
	a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9909020">paper I
	wrote in 1999</a>.  It solves a simple but fundamental problem
	about the representation of states in quantum mechanics.  The
	benefits of this were: (a) I have a pretty good idea of how
	the result was discovered*<span class="marginnote">* This
	sounds facetious, but is not; I don't think we really know
	what's going on in our </span>; (b) the argument is extremely
	simple; (c) it's an argument based almost entirely around
	several switches of representation.

      <p>
	Third, it seems to me that <em>an environment for doing
	mathematics needs an exquisite, supremely flexible and
	expressive type system</em>.  I say this with some
	trepidation, since theorists of programming languages have
	developed a theory of types, but that really doesn't seem to
	be what I'm talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let me see if I can explain what I mean by this.  Suppose I'm
	investigating a problem in quantum computing, and in the
	course of the problem I encounter some matrix, $M$, which I
	realize is central to the problem.  As soon as I see such a
	matrix, all sorts of lights go &ndash; I will have in mind
	results like: (a) the singular value decomposition; (b) the
	Schur decomposition; (c) the fact that the matrix has at least
	one eigenvector (if it's a complex matrix), and so on.  But I
	may suspect that the matrix is Hermitian.  Often that can be
	proved with just a little work.  If I can do that, then I
	immediately add a few extra facts: (d) the matrix is
	diagonalizable by a unitary matrix; (e) the matrix has real
	eigenvalues on the diagonal; (f) the singular values are the
	absolute values of the eigenvalues, and so on.  Having
	established the Hermitian property, I may suspect that the
	matrix is positive.  If I can establish that, I get access to
	another new slew of facts.  And so on.  Ultimately, one ends
	up reasoning about objects where you have long lists of
	properties: this is a positive, Hermitian matrix, with
	such-and-such a gap between the first and second largest
	eigenvalues, the trace is such-and-such, and so on.  You must
	be able to hold all those properties in your head, understand
	the implications of the properties, and how they relate to one
	another.

      <p>
	What I am trying to convey here is that when reasoning about
	mathematical objects I am constantly learning new things about
	them, and that changes my internal representation of the
	object.  In many ways, that seems to be much of what
	mathematics is: little incremental increases in knowledge,
	noticing this and that property, gradually building up your
	understanding.  Needless to say, this process of constantly
	updating one's understanding is not like the type system in
	most programming languages.  Yet it nonetheless seems somewhat
	close in spirit.  What you want is a type system which is
	flexible enough to express all these many, many properties.
	When thinking about problems the kind of thing I find myself
	thinking is "Well, this matrix has a pretty large spectral
	gap, but not too large, it's about a factor such-and-such
	smaller than this matrix over here".  What sort of type system
	would support such a statement?*<span class="marginnote">*
	Ideally, the type system would allow some ambiguity, which is
	often extremely helpful when getting a feeling for a
	mathematical problem.  But even an expressive system without
	much tolerance for ambiguity would be useful.</span>

      <p>
	When I look at existing systems for doing mathematics, I don't
	see this.  When I'm using Python / numpy to do linear algebra
	I have very limited ways of expressing even such basic facts
	as that a matrix is Hermitian, or unitary, much less the
	actual way in which I think about the objects, in terms of
	towers of interrelating properties.  And because the system is
	so unaware of the actual nature of the mathematical objects
	it's manipulating, it has no means of helping express what I
	know (or ought to know) about those objects.

      <p>
	I've used the term <em>type system</em> here with some
	trepidation.  The term doesn't have quite the right
	connotations: people think of type systems as dry things, not
	as things connected to beautiful, expressive user interfaces.
	But I'm thinking of the type as being intimately connected to
	the user interface.  In this view, a srubbable number
	is <em>not</em> the same type as an ordinary number.  In other
	words, when I say "type" I'm really referring both to a rich
	concept of what a mathematical object is, and rich ways of
	allowing the user to interact with it, and to relate it to
	other objects.

      <p>
	Let me finish this section with
	a <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining">little
	story</a> from Thurston about thinking about mathematics:
	
	<blockquote>
	  <em>
	    How big a gap is there between how you think about
	    mathematics and what you say to others?  Do you say what
	    you're thinking?  Please give either personal examples of
	    how your thoughts and words differ, or describe how they
	    are connected for you... mathematicians often have
	    unspoken thought processes guiding their work which may be
	    difficult to explain, or they feel too ihibited to
	    try... Once I mentioned this phenomenon to Andy Gleason;
	    he immediately responded that when he taught algebra
	    courses, if he was discussing cyclic subgroups of a group,
	    he had a mental image of group elements breaking into a
	    formation organized into circular groups.  He said that
	    'we' never would say anything like that to the students.
	    His words made a vivid picture in my head, because it fit
	    with how I thought about groups.  I was reminded of my
	    long struggle as a student, trying to
	    attach <em>meaning</em> to 'group', rather than just a
	    collection of symbols, words, definitions, theorems and
	    proofs that I read in a texbook.
	  </em>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
	  Why can't we see that picture?  Preferably with a powerful
	  interface, as part of an environment in which to think and
	  create.

      <h2>Making the abstract concrete</h2>

      <blockquote>
	<em>To a certain extent, a person's mathematical skill is tied
	  to their ability to... make the abstract more concrete.</em>
      </blockquote> 

      <p>
	Later in the essay, Victor
	quotes <a href="http://www.osteele.com/">Oliver Steele</a> in
	a similar vein:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>
	  Anything that remains abstract (in the sense of not
	  concrete) is hard to think about... I think that
	  mathematicians are those who succeed in figuring out how to
	  think concretely about things that are abstract, so that
	  they aren't abstract anymore. And I believe that
	  mathematical thinking encompasses the skill of learning to
	  think of an abstract thing concretely, often using multiple
	  representations – this is part of how to think about more
	  things as "things". So rather than avoiding abstraction, I
	  think it's important to absorb it, and concretize the
	  abstract... One way to concretize something abstract might
	  be to show an instance of it alongside something that is
	  already concrete.
	</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	I want to riff on these statements for a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
	Let me start with some examples where abstract concepts are
	explicitly made more concrete.  A nice collection of examples
	comes from the answers to
	a <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/25983/intuitive-crutches-for-higher-dimensional-thinking">question</a>
	on MathOverflow*<span class="marginnote">* A non-trivial
	fraction of the discussion on MathOverflow is about making
	abstract concepts more concrete.  This may be viewed as an
	empirical confirmation of the fact that mathematicians spend
	much of their time trying to understand mathematical objects
	in more familiar terms.</span>, asking how to think in more
	than three dimensions?  It's instructive to look through all
	the answers, but I will quote just two here.  The first is
	from <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/">Terry Tao</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>[...] when dealing with the geometry of high-dimensional
	(or infinite-dimensional) vector spaces such as R^n, there are
	plenty of ways to conceptualise these spaces that do not
	require visualising more than three dimensions directly. For
	instance, one can view a high-dimensional vector space as a
	state space for a system with many degrees of freedom. A
	megapixel image, for instance, is a point in a
	million-dimensional vector space; by varying the image, one
	can explore the space, and various subsets of this space
	correspond to various classes of images. One can similarly
	interpret sound waves, a box of gases, an ecosystem, a voting
	population, a stream of digital data, trials of random
	variables, the results of a statistical survey, a
	probabilistic strategy in a two-player game, and many other
	concrete objects as states in a high-dimensional vector space,
	and various basic concepts such as convexity, distance,
	linearity, change of variables, orthogonality, or inner
	product can have very natural meanings in some of these models
	(though not in all). It can take a bit of both theory and
	practice to merge one's intuition for these things with one's
	spatial intuition for vectors and vector spaces, but it can be
	done eventually (much as after one has enough exposure to
	measure theory, one can start merging one's intuition
	regarding cardinality, mass, length, volume, probability,
	cost, charge, and any number of other "real-life"
	measures). For instance, the fact that most of the mass of a
	unit ball in high dimensions lurks near the boundary of the
	ball can be interpreted as a manifestation of the law of large
	numbers, using the interpretation of a high-dimensional vector
	space as the state space for a large number of trials of a
	random variable. More generally, many facts about
	low-dimensional projections or slices of high-dimensional
	objects can be viewed from a probabilistic, statistical, or
	signal processing perspective.</em> 
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	The second answer comes
	from <a href="http://scottaaronson.com">Scott Aaronson</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<em>Here are some of the crutches I've relied on. (Admittedly,
	my crutches are probably much more useful for theoretical
	computer science, combinatorics, and probability than they are
	for geometry, topology, or physics. On a related note, I
	personally have a much easier time thinking about $R^n$ than
	about, say, $R^4$ or $R^5$!)

	<ol>
	  <li>
	    If you're trying to visualize some 4D phenomenon P, first
	    think of a related 3D phenomenon P', and then imagine
	    yourself as a 2D being who's trying to visualize P'. The
	    advantage is that, unlike with the 4D vs. 3D case, you
	    yourself can easily switch between the 3D and 2D
	    perspectives, and can therefore get a sense of exactly
	    what information is being lost when you drop a
	    dimension. (You could call this the "Flatland trick,"
	    after the most famous literary work to rely on it.)

	  <li>
	    As someone else mentioned, discretize! Instead of thinking
	    about $R^n$, think about the Boolean hypercube
	    $\{0,1\}^n$, which is finite and usually easier to get
	    intuition about. (When working on problems, I often find
	    myself drawing $\{0,1\}^4$ on a sheet of paper by drawing
	    two copies of $\{0,1\}^3$ and then connecting the
	    corresponding vertices.)

	  <li>
	    Instead of thinking about a subset $S \subseteq R^n$,
	    think about its characteristic function $f : R^n
	    \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$. I don't know why that trivial
	    perspective switch makes such a big difference, but it
	    does... maybe because it shifts your attention to the
	    process of computing $f$, and makes you forget about the
	    hopeless task of visualizing $S$!

	  <li>
	    One of the central facts about $R^n$ is that, while it has
	    "room" for only $n$ orthogonal vectors, it has room for
	    $\exp(n)$ almost-orthogonal vectors. Internalize that one
	    fact, and so many other properties of $R^n$ (for example,
	    that the $n$-sphere resembles a "ball with spikes sticking
	    out," as someone mentioned before) will suddenly seem
	    non-mysterious. In turn, one way to internalize the fact
	    that $R^n$ has so many almost-orthogonal vectors is to
	    internalize Shannon's theorem that there exist good
	    error-correcting codes.

	  <li>
	    To get a feel for some high-dimensional object, ask
	    questions about the behavior of a process that takes place
	    on that object. For example: if I drop a ball here, which
	    local minimum will it settle into? How long does this
	    random walk on $\{0,1\}^n$ take to mix?
	</ol>
	</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Both these answers relate "how to think in high dimensions?"
	to problems that the authors of the answers already
	understand.  Some of those problems, like thinking about a
	megapixel image, are problems that most people understand,
	even people with little mathematical training.  In other
	cases, like thinking about characteristic functions, this is
	more specialized knowledge. However, the core in both cases is
	to represent the problem in terms of something you already
	have some understanding of.  The deeper your understanding of
	the old representation, and the more powerful a connection you
	forge, the deeper your understanding of the new problem.  Note
	that the connection need not always be precise.  As an
	undergraduate I worried a lot about how to think about
	high-dimensional objects.  I was amused (and somewhat
	relieved) as a grad student to find that discussions of
	high-dimensional objects were often accompanied merely by a
	picture of a blob on a blackboard, yet the picture actually
	really did seem to help inform my intuition!  (There are, of
	course, various embellishments of this idea one can use
	&ndash; there's a nice
	example <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/a/26010">here</a>.)

      <p>
	Neither of the answers above is quite about making the
	abstract concrete.  Rather, it's to <em>understand the
	unfamiliar in terms of things we already understand well.</em>
	Of course, when someone knows little about mathematics, that
	means finding explanation in terms of what we usually think of
	as the concrete.  But when they learn more mathematics, they
	start to think of things like characteristic functions and the
	Boolean hypercube as concrete.  It makes perfect sense to
	Scott Aaronson to talk about $R^n$ having exponentially many
	almost-orthogonal vectors.  He's thought about this a lot; for
	him it's an important fact, a fact which is connected to many
	other things.

      <p>
	We've dwindled to the vacuously true.  Everyone would no doubt
	agree that it's true that we should understand the unfamiliar
	in terms of things we already understand well.  But so what?
	I think it's worth taking away a few simple observations: (1)
	Systems for doing mathematics typically assume that
	you've <em>already</em> gone through this process, and make
	little (or no) explicit effort to help with it; (2) Of course,
	such systems can be used to help go through this process
	(e.g., I used <em>Maple</em> to learn about hypergeometric
	functions, by playing with plots).  Doing this well requires
	some non-obvious meta-cognitive strategies; (3) These
	strategies could be reified within the system, either through
	user interface elements, or perhaps through less subtle
	methods, such as interactive essays which setup a playground
	for us to understand the new in terms of the old.


      <p>
	<strong>On genius:</strong> Most people have had the
	experience of talking with someone who seems to them to have
	lightning mathematical insight.  You mention a problem to that
	person, something you have struggled with for hours or, in
	extreme cases, months or years.  <em>Voila</em>, they solve it
	nearly instantly.  What a genius!

      <p>
	This phenomenon occurs at every level, from elementary school
	to discussions amongst professional mathematicians.  From the
	point of view of the person posing the problem, the "genius"
	appears to have special magical powers, abilities they do not
	have, and perhaps feel they will never have.

      <p>
	I believe this is wrong.  I don't believe such a "genius" has
	access to some special ability that other people don't have.
	There is no such genius; instead, there are people who
	systematically search out more ways of representing
	mathematical objects in terms of things they already
	understand well.  They then slowly and laboriously practice
	using those many representations, until they come to seem
	simple and natural.  This is more prosaic than the
	genius-with-special-powers story, but I believe it's more
	likely to be correct.  It should be possible to support this
	process in our systems.

      <p>
	<strong>Mastering new representations can make it trivial to
	solve problems that otherwise seemed difficult or
	impossible.</strong>  This is a reiteration of the last point,
	from a slightly different example.  I wanted to write down a
	very concrete example of how mastery of new representations
	can trivialize formerly difficult problems.  The example does
	not, alas, involve any nice new representations &ndash; it's a
	great problem to develop an environment (maybe an extension of
	the difference equation solver) which does.  But I though it
	might nonetheless be useful to keep in mind as an example of
	this process.

      <p>
	Suppose I ask you to prove that the square root of two is
	irrational, that is, it's impossible to write the square root
	of two as a ratio of two integers $m$ and $n$:

	\begin{eqnarray}
	\sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n}.
	\end{eqnarray}

      <p>
	Now, let's suppose that you don't know a whole lot about
	number theory.  Maybe you're a high-school student.  But it
	just happens that you've really mastered
	the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">fundamental
	theorem of arithmetic</a>, that is, the idea that every
	integer can be uniquely represented as a product of prime
	numbers.  It's not just the case that understand the statement
	and proof of the theorem, you've actively applied it in many
	different circumstances.  If that's the case then it becomes
	second nature to try to apply it to problems involving
	integers, multiplication, and divisibility.  You also tend to
	notice when it's possible to turn everything in the problem
	into an integer, which we can do by squaring the equation
	above, and moving $n$ to the left-hand side,

	\begin{eqnarray}
	2 n^2 = m^2.
	\end{eqnarray}

	To someone used to thinking in terms of products of prime
	number it's obvious that the left-hand side has an odd number
	of prime factors, and the right-hand side has an even number
	of prime factors.  This is impossible by the uniqueness of the
	prime factorization.  And so our original assumption, that
	$\sqrt{2} = m / n$, must have been false, and we see that the
	square root of $2$ is irrational.

      <p>
	If you only know a little number theory, but just happen to
	have mastered the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, then
	proving the square root of $2$ is irrational is very nearly
	the kind of thing you can see in a flash of insight.  I began
	verbally explaining the above proof to my wife (a PhD in
	theoretical physics), only to have her cut me off after less
	than thirty seconds with a delighted exlamation of "Oh, I
	see!"  But someone who happens not to have mastered the
	fundamental theorem (but otherwise has a comparable
	background) is likely to have a much tougher time seeing why
	the result is true.  Certainly, the proofs I saw as a student
	were rather more cumbersome, in part because they didn't
	assume that we'd really mastered the fundamental theorem of
	arithmetic.

      <p>
	Of course, it is perfectly possible for someone to have
	"understood" the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, yet still
	have trouble arriving at the proof above.  The reason is that
	mastering the theorem doesn't just mean knowing the content.
	It also means: (a) knowing when it's likely to apply (problems
	concerning multiplication and division and lots of integer
	terms are often good candidates, problems involving lots of
	additions are often harder to apply it to); (b) knowing when
	to apply heuristics like recasting your problem in a form
	where as many things are integers as possible; and (c) having
	considerable facility with basic algebra.

      <p>
	<strong>Problem:</strong> Develop a prototype environment
	which makes this kind of change in representation easier.

      <h2>Questions / to do</h2>

      <p>
	I'll stop there with the notes.  Obviously, there's much more
	to be done.  Let me conclude with a few final notes on things
	to explore.

      <p>
	What's the connection to other specific questions I am
	interested in: What comes after the web?  What is the simplest
	system design that would support (most of) the experience of
	the web?  Why is paper-and-pencil still so much better than a
	computer for so many types of exploration?  What will change
	that?  (Broadly: the really good pattern recognition that is
	now coming online, together with new hardware and UI design;
	this should open up entirely new worlds.).

      <p>
	What's the connection to other big picture problems that I'm
	interested in?  E.g.: designing group behaviour; designing
	institutions; the allocation of expert attention; amplifying
	collective intelligence; open science; scaling human systems;
	and artificial intelligence.

      <p>
	To push further in the directions described here, I'd need to
	learn to program well, and to design user interfaces well.
	Both these abilities seem to me to be super-powers, enlarging
	in a way similar to learning to write; it's well worth taking
	time to acquire at least a basic facility with them.  The
	combination to practice over and over is something like:
	"Sketch out a design problem; sketch out an initial (really
	bad) idea for a solution; implement; criticise the problem and
	solution; iterate".  I found even the very simple problems in
	these notes &ndash; the non-linear scrubbable numbers and the
	sine visualization &ndash; quite challenging (and informative)
	to build out.  With much more experience

      Lots and lots of design, challenging myself frequently to step
      up to a new level.  I found even the rather simple examples here
      quite onerous to do.  That is, of course, due to a lack of basic
      fluency and experience on my part.

	<strong>Collect problems.</strong>  In particular, it's worth
	collecting even problems that seem trivial.  I learnt quite a
	bit attacking the granularity problem above.  Victor's essay
	<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and
	Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a> shows the great depth even
	in a problem such as: how to drive a (simulated) car down a
	(simulated) road?

TO get good at programming: write many programs, do lots of iteration to improve the programs.  The programs should preferably be important to me, based on ideas which matter to me, and they should push me to develop in new ways.

Two traps: (1) learning to program by working slowly and methodically
through books; one needs genuine project work to which one is
committed; (2) learning to program through projects only; you end

I'm talking about programming as a monolithic skill.  But it's not a
monolithic skill. Particular things to get good at:

It's a mistake to focus too much on programming.  The term "great
programmer" is sometimes used to mean someone very good at
implementing someone else's specification.  This seems to me like
those writers who can quickly write great prose, but who don't know
what to write about (Martin Amis comes to mind).  Yes, the ability to
code is important.  But knowing what to code is even more important.
This means developing great taste in problems.


Without great
designs, all the programming skill in

Design is difficult:
