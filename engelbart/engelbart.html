	&ldquo;By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the
	capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation,
	to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to
	derive solutions to problems&hellip; whether the problem
	situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not
	speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular
	situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain
	where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human "feel
	for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts,
	streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods,
	and high-powered electronic aids. &rdquo;

      <p>
	What is 427 x 784?
      </p>
      
      <p class="slide">
	Hard for an unaided human.

      <p class="slide">
	Even harder: what is 721,269,127 x 422,599,421?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Both problems become easy with paper and pencil.

      <p class="slide">
	This is strange, <em>a priori</em>: wood pulp + wood +
	graphite = more intellectual capability!

      <p class="slide"> We're <em>used</em> to this, but that doesn't
	 mean we understand it.  What's actually going on?  For what
	 class of problems does paper and pencil help?  For what class
	 of problems does it not help (or hinder)?  How much can it
	 help?

      <h2>Questions</h2>

      <p>
	Is there a theory of how humans and machines work together?
	Or, at the least, some general principles governing behaviour?
      </p>

      <p>
	Can we find principles that will help us design more powerful
	human-machine systems?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Engelbart's paper sketches out a research program that aims
	toward &ndash; very roughly speaking &ndash; these ends.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Because the paper is a sketch it is often highly speculative,
	and sometimes rather vague.  It's more a cool-headed manifesto
	than a typical paper.  We won't attempt to grok the whole
	thing &ndash; indeed, I certainly don't grok the whole thing.
	Instead, we'll focus narrowly, and try to begin understanding
	a few of the deep ideas.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	In other words, I'm riffing on the paper, drawing connections
	to other work, and asking questions.  Please jump in!

      <h2>Problem solving as symbol structuring</h2>

      <p>
	Writing a book is the art of &ldquo;sitting down and putting a
	hundred thousand words in a cunning order&rdquo; (Douglas
	Adams)
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Engelbart viewed augmentation as being to a great extent about
	developing new ways of manipulating and structuring symbols:
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	&ldquo;One way of viewing the H-LAM/T system changes that we
	contemplate--specifically, integrating the capabilities of a
	digital computer into the intellectual activity of individual
	humans--is that we are introducing new and extremely advanced
	means for externally manipulating symbols. We then want to
	determine the useful modifications in the language and in the
	way of thinking that could result.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Examples of systems for structuring symbols: the
	multiplication algorithm, diary, calendar, GTD, org-mode,
	outlining tool, Word, Emacs, etc.
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Scrivener</h2>

      <img src="assets/scrivener.png" width="600" style="float: right;">

      <p>
	<em>Scrivener</em> is a popular outlining tool used by writers.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	I suspect much of its popularity is due to <em>one</em> piece
	of symbol structuring it does: a clear, built-in division
	between research notes and draft material, making it easy to
	jump back and forth.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	The creators of <em>Scrivener</em> have taken a process that
	formerly had to be done manually by writers, and built a
	system of cues that make it easy and natural.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	It's not difficult for a writer with the right habits to do
	this manually.  But <em>Scrivener</em> makes it hard to avoid,
	providing all the right cues at the right moments.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	In other words it provides an environment for the <em>simple
	process stuff</em> done by experts.
      </p>
	
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Capabilities</h2>

      <p>
	Engelbart divides our (augmented) problem-solving capabilities
	up:
	<ol>
	  <li>Basic capabilities;
	  </li>

	  <li>The repertoire hierarchy of capabilities, built up from
	  the basic capabilities.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	This division is a very clever move.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	It's tempting to focus primarily on changes to basic
	capabilities.  Many of those changes will <em>appear</em>
	trivial.
      </p>
	
      <p class="slide">
	By also concentrating on the repertoire hierarchy as an
	important object of study, we are alerted to the fact that
	even a tiny change to basic capabilities
	may <em>propagate</em> through the repertoire hierarchy to
	cause major changes in effective intellect.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	<em>Scrivener's</em> division into research and draft is only
	a small addition to the basic capabilities.  But it propagates
	all through the writing process to cause a major change in
	results.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      
      <p>
	What are some other examples of small changes in basic
	capabilities that cause large changes in the repertoire
	hierarchy?  
      </p>

      <p>
	In particular, can we think of really small changes that give
	rise to huge changes in the reportoire hierarchy?
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Possible sources of inspiration may come from: Emacs, Word,
	GTD, diary, your favourite programming language, <em>etc</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Can we think of characteristics that mean a small change will
	have an especially large impact?
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>The impact of our means of manipulating symbols</h2>
      
      <p>
	&ldquo;The Whorfian hypothesis states that the world view of a
	culture is limited by the structure of the language which that
	culture uses. But there seems to be another factor to consider
	in the evolution of language and human reasoning ability. We
	offer the following hypothesis, which is related to the
	Whorfian hypothesis: Both the language used by a culture, and
	the capability for effective intellectual activity are
	directly affected during their evolution by the means by which
	individuals control the external manipulation of
	symbols.&rdquo;

      <p>Symbols are no longer static.  They're dynamic, interactive.
      They have both a user interface and the ability to interact with
      one another.  If the symbols are well-designed, there is the
      potential for emergent, collective behaviour, and new forms of
      meaning (as with language).  Giving more powerful means of
      expresion changes the basic capabilities, and, if well chosen,
      this may affect the entire repertoire hierarchy.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Questions</h2>

      <p>
	What other examples are there of introducing new symbols for
	expresing thought?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	What makes a new symbol particularly powerful?  What makes a
	new symbol weak?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	What would be some fun things to prototype?

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>What's missing from Engelbart's paper?</h2>

      <p>
	He views problem solving as being all about information
	handling: symbol structuring.
      </p>

      <p>
	But there is a very large &ndash; maybe primary &ndash; factor,
	which is emotional involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
	Someone deeply committed with bad tools is often much more
	effective than someone uncommitted who has great tools.
      </p>

      <p>
	How can we use computers to change people's emotional
	experience?
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Papert's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746">Mindstorms</a>
	is pretty good on this.
