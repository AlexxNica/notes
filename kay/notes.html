"knowledge manipulator": interesting term.
</p>
<p>
"dynamic medium": very interesting term.  Emphasizes that it is a
medium.  I think Bret uses this term, too.
</p>
<p>
"We felt strongly that the major design problems of the <i>Dynabook</i> lay
in the area of communication [software?] rather than in new hardware
architectures."  Not sure how this relates to Kay's emphasis on doing
own hardware.
</p>
<p>
"Interim Dynabook": I like it! What a great thing to be doing multiple
iterations quickly, in a research environment, without the need to
ship.  This is research!  I really like the fact that he named the
system, and that he

"Gell-Mann has remarked that education in the 20th century is like
being taken to the world's greatest restaraunt and being fed the menu.
He meant that representations of ideas have replaced the ideas
themselves; students are taught superficially about great discoveries
instead of being helped to learn deeply for themselves.  In the near
future, all the representations that human beings have invented will
be instantly accessible anywhere in the world on intimate,
notebook-size computers.  But will we be able to get from the menu to
the food?  Or will we no longer understand the difference betwteen the
two?  Worse, will we lose even the ability to read the menu and be
satistifed just to recognize that it is one?"
</p>
<p>
Some of the most effective people I know are super-skimmers and
integrators who can glue lots of stuff together.  They'll have great
project ideas, and be able to glue together extant materials to make
those projects come to life easily.
</p>
<p>
To try to sharpen that up: there's an integration ability that
involves the cultivation of skimming and these relatively shallow
representations that Kay is talking about.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Adler's "How to read a book".  He makes the point that
it's possible to be good at reading a book in 10 minutes, 10 hours, 10
days, 10 years.  This is the ability to read 100 books in 10 hours,
and to integrate them to create something new.  It's a kind of
remix-ability, or something like that.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it makes sense to cultivate this ability at search and
integration <i>as well as</i> the kind of in-depth understanding that Kay
is talking about.
</p>
<p>
I don't think that integrative ability has ever been named.  Synoptic
ability?  Integrative ability?  I think it's defined by a mixture of
integrative ability, good search ability, taste, and some other
qualities.  It'd be nice to name this, and to understand what exactly
it involves.
</p>
<p>
"In the Open School&hellip; the machines do not substitute for teachers.
They are thought of as "just another material," like books, paints and
clay, that can support the children's activities."
</p>
<p>
I like this.  It's taking the computer as medium of expression
seriously.
</p>
<p>
There's an old question about whether discovery-based learning is the
right way to go.  The debate tends to set things up in rather polar
views: all discovery-based versus sage-on-a-stage (or similar) models.
That's misleading.  What is undoubtedly true is that <i>more</i>
discovery-based learning is a good idea.
</p>
<p>
"we are quite capable of devising new mental bricks, new ways of
thinking, that can enormously expand the understandings we can attain.
The bricks we develop become new technologies for thinking."
</p>
<p>
"the need for struggle should not be grounds for avoidance.
Difficulty should be sought out, as a spur to delving more deeply into
an interesting area.  An educational system that tries to make
everything easy and pleasurable will prevent much important learning
from happening."
</p>
<p>
It's interesting that in many parts of life &ndash; sport and video games
come to mind &ndash; making things easy also makes them <i>unpleasurable</i>.
We love to struggle, under some circumstances.
