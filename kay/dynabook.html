      <h2>Notes on the Dynabook</h2>

      <p>
	Computing as envisioned circa 1960:
      </p>

      <p>
	"The only surviving computing system paradigm seen by MIT
	students and faculty was that of a very large International
	Business Machine in a tightly sealed Computation Center: the
	computer not as a <em>tool</em>, but as a <em>demigod</em>."
	&ndash;
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7HpQAAAAMAAJ">Wesley
	Clark</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	<img src="assets/children.png" style="float: right;"></img>
	Computing as envisioned in Alan
	Kay's <a href="Dynabook.pdf">"A Personal Computer for Children
	of All Ages"</a> (1972, what I'll call &ldquo;the Dynabook
	paper&rdquo;):
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Many of the ideas in the Dynabook paper now appear
	commonplace, even banal.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	That's because those ideas won.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	At the time, this kind of thinking was a big change in
	perspective from computers-as-demigods.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	The Dynabook paper (and related work) was posing a fundamental
	new question: what might personal computing for everyone be?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	By facing squarely up to this (and some related) questions,
	PARC invented much of the foundation for modern personal
	computing. 
      </p>

	Slides by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org">Michael
	Nielsen</a>, for a small-group discussion with people from the
	<a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, December
	2015.  The slides are brief, <strong>very rough</strong> and
	incomplete working notes on a tiny, tiny slice of work related
	to the Dynabook.

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>What we're going to do</h2>

      <p>
	We're going to wallow in some of the ideas around the
	Dynabook.  Not a collection of facts, not about mastering
	particular technologies and systems. Rather, about powerful,
	generative questions and principles and intuitions.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Little point in memorizing these, or treating them as
	Gospel. Better to engage deeply with them, fight back with our
	own ideas, mash up and collide with other powerful ideas, use
	as a crucible for creation.  My belief is that we can go a
	lot, lot further.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	As Kay puts
	it: <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf">The
	Real Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="slide">
	To that end: this is a conversation, not a monologue.  Ask
	questions, point out connections, argue with me, Kay, and
	everyone else.  Riff, riff, riff.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	I'll certainly be grinding some axes
      </p>
      
      <p class="slide">
	There is no necessity to &ldquo;get through everything&rdquo;.
	The goal is to marinate in ideas, and to distill out a changed
	understanding, not to make it to some notional endpoint.

      <h2>Are we building tools?  Or media?</h2>

      <p>
	A distinction implicit in much of Kay's discussion is between building
	tools versus building a medium.  For instance:
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	<em>What then is a personal computer?  One would hope that it
	would be both a medium for containing and expressing arbitrary
	symbolic notions, and also a collection of useful tools for
	manipulating these structures, with ways to add new tools to
	the repertoire.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	There's a useful distinction here.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Tools solve very specific problems.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Cut-and-paste is a tool.  The lassoo is a tool.  Even
	something like changing the font size is a tool.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	A medium, by contrast, is a platform for some broad class of
	creative expression.  You can imagine carrying out a
	meaningful creative project within such a medium.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Photoshop is a medium.  Microsoft Word is a medium.  The web
	browser is a medium.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	The distinguishing question seems to be: can you imagine using
	this program to build a significant creative project?  If yes,
	it's a medium.  If no, it's a tool.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Tools often have specific inputs which map to specific
	outputs.  But media typically have generic inputs which are
	transformed by the user to imagined outputs.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Tools are tremendously important.  But media are the overall
	environment we use to think and create.  And so, to me, they
	hold more overall interest.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Building a model of oneself</h2>

      <p>
	Kay: <em>an environment which...  allows [a child] to <em>gain
	    a model of himself</em> is tremendously important.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	What does Kay mean to gain a model of oneself?
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Possibly Kay is talking about experiences which change our
	self-perception:
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	E.g. "When I played tennis as a teenager I learnt that I
	enjoyed being on a team more than working solo." [or vice
	versa, it doesn't matter: the crucial point is a more
	developed understanding of self]
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	A more sophisticated understanding of self may be: "I have the
	following skills / preferences / values, and that helps me get
	more out of being on a team than being solo."
      </p>
	
      <p class="slide">
	To what extent does this matter?  Why does it matter or not
	matter?  Does it matter for all people, not just children?
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Building a model of oneself</h2>

      <p>
	To what extent does existing software help people develop a
	model of themselves?
      </p>

      
      <p class="slide">
	"I'm a Wikipedian."  "I'm a blogger."  "I'm a designer who
	uses Illustrator."  "I'm a [insert identity]."  These are
	sometimes strongly associated with developing specific traits
	that people are aware of having, and which they have theories
	about.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Flipside: certain business models rely on short-term user
	engagement, but have negative effects on the user's long-term
	welfare.  The result may be self-loathing, an alienation from
	and diminished model of self.
      </p>

    </section>
    

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Verbs and nouns</h2>

      <p>
	Kay: "We feel that a child is a &ldquo;verb&rdquo; rather than
	a &ldquo;noun&rdquo"
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	This point of view is in opposition to the point of view taken
	by educators (or by traditional media).
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	We &ldquo;educate&rdquo; people, that is, education is
	something which someone well-informed &ldquo;does to&rdquo;
	someone who is ignorant.  Those people are passive receptors,
	things that are operated on by teachers.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Another point of view is that people educate themselves.  The
	most anyone can do is create enabling circumstances.
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Even without taking a point of view on this, an interesting
	thing about personal computers is that they can provide a
	structured, responsive environment for individual exploration.
	That's difficult in traditional classrooms.  And so it creates
	an interesting possibility.
      </p>
      
    </section>

    <section class="slide">

      <p>
	Kay: <em>For most of recorded history the interactions of
	  humans with their media have been primarily
	  nonconversational and passive... A mathematical
	  formulation-which may symbolize the essence of an entire
	  universe-once put down on paper, remains static and requires
	  the reader to expand its possibilities.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="slide">
	Consider <em>E = mc<sup>2</sup></em>.
      </p>

      <p>
	These are Unicode characters.
      </p>

      <p>
	On paper, characters are lifeless entities.  We've copied
	that.
