	I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a
	position in the Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your
	letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems
	that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a
	false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile
	problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the
	ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is
	grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some
	way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to
	take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you
	find some you can really solve easily, no matter how
	trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping
	your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in
	the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take
	away from yourself these pleasures because you have some
	erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.

	<p>
	You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be
	concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same
	time I had another Ph.D.  Student (Albert Hibbs) was on how it
	is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the
	sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with
	the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I
	gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and
	left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant
	or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may
	do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this
	letter to correct it a little.
	
	<p>
	I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call
	humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I
	sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on
	the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to
	try to learn something about how friction worked
	(failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depends on
	the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make
	electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio
	knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the
	reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating
	glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The
	design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture
	electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General
	theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child’s
	toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light
	nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years
	on it without success). Plus all the “grander” problems of
	quantum theory.

	<p>
	No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do
	something about it.

	<p>
	You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and
	to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate
	colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they
	come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not
	remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. now
	your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in
	terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of
	what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.

	<p>
	Best of luck and happiness.  
	
	<p>
	Sincerely, 

	<p>
	Richard P. Feynman.

      <strong>&ndash; letter from Feynman to a former student</strong>

      <blockquote>
	In those critical years I learned how to be alone. [But even]
	this formulation doesn't really capture my meaning. I didn't,
	in any literal sense, learn to be alone, for the simple reason
	that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my
	childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of
	our birth. However these three years of work in isolation
	[1945-1948], when I was thrown onto my own resources,
	following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously
	invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence,
	unassuming yet enduring in my ability to do mathematics, which
	owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as
	law. By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the
	things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions
	of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less
	extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for
	any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This
	silent consensus had informed me both at the lycee and at the
	university, that one shouldn't bother worrying about what was
	really meant when using a term like "volume" which was
	"obviously self-evident", "generally known," "in problematic"
	etc... it is in this gesture of "going beyond" to be in oneself
	rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay
	within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one -- it
	is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All
	others things follow as a matter of course.

	<p>
	  Since then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics
	  that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both
	  among my "elders" and among young people in my general age
	  group who were more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I
	  was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if
	  at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them
	  from the cradle -- while for myself I felt clumsy, even
	  oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb
	  ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to learn
	  (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding
	  the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed,
	  there was little about me that identified the kind of bright
	  student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates
	  almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.
	  
	  <p>
	    In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more
	    brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished
	    mathematicians. Still from the perspective of thirty or
	    thirty five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
	    mathematics of our time has not been very
	    profound. They've done all things, often beautiful things
	    in a context that was already set out before them, which
	    they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of
	    it, they've remained prisoners of those invisible and
	    despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain
	    milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they
	    would have to rediscover in themselves that capability
	    which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity
	    to be alone.
