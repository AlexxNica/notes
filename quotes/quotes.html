      <strong>Leonard
      Adleman</strong>: <a href="http://teacher.scu.edu.cn/ftp_teacher0/chjtang/teach/adleman.htm">Interview</a>
      with Diane Krieger.

      <blockquote>
	<strong>Q:</strong> They say the most creative and challenging
	part of research is finding the right question to ask. Do you
	agree with that?
	
	<p>
	  <strong>LA:</strong> I wouldn't characterize it as the most
	  challenging thing, but it's of critical
	  importance. Sometimes it's not hard to find the 'right
	  question'. For example the mathematics literature is full of
	  very important unanswered questions. In this case, the real
	  issue is: Has that question's time come?  Have we reached a
	  point where developments in the appropriate area of science
	  give us some chance of breaking the problem?  For example, I
	  worked on a famous centuries old math problem called
	  "Fermat's Last Theorem". I was not 'strong' enough to solve
	  it, but I find some solace in the fact that my intuition
	  that its 'time had come' was right. The problem was finally
	  solved two years ago by Andrew Wiles of Princeton. It was
	  one of the major events in the history of mathematics.

	<p>
	  The other side is to generate new questions. That's a funny
	  process. The way I seek to generate new questions is to
	  start to look at whole new fields, like biology, immunology
	  or physics. Since I come from a different field,
	  mathematics, I bring an unusual point-of-view that sometimes
	  allows me to generate questions different from the classical
	  questions in those areas. Like the question of DNA
	  computing.

	<p>
	  For the young scientist, this question of choosing the right
	  question to spend your valuable limited intellectual
	  resources on is critical. I often sit for months and do no
	  productive work that anybody can see, because I don't feel I
	  have a good enough question to work on. Rather than take on
	  some lesser question, I would prefer to read a mystery
	  novel. The point is, sometimes it's important to lie fallow
	  for a time waiting for the 'right question' to appear,
	  rather than to engage in uninspiring work and miss the
	  important opportunity when in comes.

	<p>
	  But in the end, the real challenge of science is to make
	  progress - to succeed, to contribute knowledge.

	<p>
	  <strong>Q:</strong> Of course, in an academic setting,
	  there's that drive to publish or perish...

	<p>
	  <strong>LA:</strong> Yes, that's a problem, because you have
	  to feed your family. But I always tell my students and
	  junior faculty that they are better off following their
	  inspiration and their hearts in what research they do, that
	  they should always try to take on the most interesting and
	  important problems, that they should not waste their time on
	  little problems just to make another line on a vitae.

	<p>
	  My philosophy is that it's important, in a curious way, for
	  scientists to be courageous. Not physically courageous, but
	  courageous in an intellectual way. I believe that by working
	  on extremely hard problems, by being courageous, you may
	  succeed. But even if you fail, you fail gloriously. And you
	  will have learned immense amounts, you will have extended
	  the envelope of what you can do. As a byproduct of failing
	  on a great problem, I have always found that I could solve
	  some lesser but still interesting problems - which then fill
	  your vitae.

      <strong>Jonathan Blow</strong>: Reply to a programmer seeking advice

      <blockquote>
	I am 42-year-old very successful programmer who has been
	through a lot of situations in my career so far, many of them
	highly demotivating. And the best advice I have for you is to
	get out of what you are doing. Really. Even though you state
	that you are not in a position to do that, you really are. It
	is okay. You are free. Okay, you are helping your boyfriend's
	startup but what is the appropriate cost for this? Would he
	have you do it if he knew it was crushing your soul?

	<p>
	  I don't use the phrase "crushing your soul" lightly. When it
	  happens slowly, as it does in these cases, it is hard to see
	  the scale of what is happening. But this is a very serious
	  situation and if left unchecked it may damage the potential
	  for you to do good work for the rest of your life. Reasons:

	<p>
	  * The commenters who are warning about burnout are
	  right. Burnout is a very serious situation. If you burn
	  yourself out hard, it will be difficult to be effective at
	  any future job you go to, even if it is ostensibly a
	  wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical injury. I
	  burned myself out once and it took at least 12 years to
	  regain full productivity. Don't do it.

	<p>
	  * More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a
	  root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel
	  joy and excitement about programming-related things, you'll
	  be unable to do the best work. That this issue is separate
	  from and parallel to burnout! If you are burned out, you
	  might still be able to feel the joy and excitement briefly
	  at the start of a project/idea, but they will fade quickly
	  as the reality of day-to-day work sets in. Alternatively, if
	  you are not burned out but also do not have a sense of
	  wonder, it is likely you will never get yourself started on
	  the good work.

	<p>
	  * The earlier in your career it is now, the more important
	  this time is for your development. Programmers learn by
	  doing. If you put yourself into an environment where you are
	  constantly challenged and are working at the top threshold
	  of your ability, then after a few years have gone by, your
	  skills will have increased tremendously. It is like going to
	  intensively learn kung fu for a few years, or going into
	  Navy SEAL training or something. But this isn't just a
	  one-time constant increase. The faster you get things done,
	  and the more thorough and error-free they are, the more
	  ideas you can execute on, which means you will learn faster
	  in the future too. Over the long term, programming skill is
	  like compound interest. More now means a LOT more
	  later. Less now means a LOT less later.

	<p>
	  So if you are putting yourself into a position that is not
	  really challenging, that is a bummer day in and day out, and
	  you get things done slowly, you aren't just having a slow
	  time now. You are bringing down that compound interest curve
	  for the rest of your career. It is a serious problem.

	<p>
	  If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly
	  cut out all the shitty jobs I did (and there were many of
	  them).

	<p>
	  One more thing, about personal identity. Early on as a
	  programmer, I was often in situations like you describe. I
	  didn't like what I was doing, I thought the management was
	  dumb, I just didn't think my work was very important. I
	  would be very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at
	  times get into a mode where I was much of the time
	  pretending progress simply because I could not bring myself
	  to do the work. I just didn't have the spirit to do it. (I
	  know many people here know what I am talking about.) Over
	  time I got depressed about this: Do I have a terrible work
	  ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad person? But
	  these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized,
	  they were just more like an ambient malaise and a
	  disappointment in where life was going.

	<p>
	  What I learned, later on, is that I do not at all have a bad
	  work ethic and I am not a bad person. In fact I am quite
	  fierce and get huge amounts of good work done, when I
	  believe that what I am doing is important. It turns out
	  that, for me, to capture this feeling of importance, I had
	  to work on my own projects (and even then it took a long
	  time to find the ideas that really moved me). But once I
	  found this, it basically turned me into a different
	  person. If this is how it works for you, the difference
	  between these two modes of life is HUGE.

	<p>
	  Okay, this has been long and rambling. I'll cut it off here. Good luck.

      <strong>Richard Feynman</strong>: Letter to a former student,
      reprinted in "Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten
      Track"

      <blockquote>
	Dear Koichi,

	<p>
	  I was very happy to hear from you, and that you have such a
	position in the Research Laboratories. Unfortunately your
	letter made me unhappy for you seem to be truly sad. It seems
	that the influence of your teacher has been to give you a
	false idea of what are worthwhile problems. The worthwhile
	problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the
	ones you can really contribute something to. A problem is
	grand in science if it lies before us unsolved and we see some
	way for us to make some headway into it. I would advise you to
	take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you
	find some you can really solve easily, no matter how
	trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping
	your fellow man, even if it is only to answer a question in
	the mind of a colleague less able than you. You must not take
	away from yourself these pleasures because you have some
	erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.

	<p>
	You met me at the peak of my career when I seemed to you to be
	concerned with problems close to the gods. But at the same
	time I had another Ph.D.  Student (Albert Hibbs) was on how it
	is that the winds build up waves blowing over water in the
	sea. I accepted him as a student because he came to me with
	the problem he wanted to solve. With you I made a mistake, I
	gave you the problem instead of letting you find your own; and
	left you with a wrong idea of what is interesting or pleasant
	or important to work on (namely those problems you see you may
	do something about). I am sorry, excuse me. I hope by this
	letter to correct it a little.
	
	<p>
	I have worked on innumerable problems that you would call
	humble, but which I enjoyed and felt very good about because I
	sometimes could partially succeed. For example, experiments on
	the coefficient of friction on highly polished surfaces, to
	try to learn something about how friction worked
	(failure). Or, how elastic properties of crystals depends on
	the forces between the atoms in them, or how to make
	electroplated metal stick to plastic objects (like radio
	knobs). Or, how neutrons diffuse out of Uranium. Or, the
	reflection of electromagnetic waves from films coating
	glass. The development of shock waves in explosions. The
	design of a neutron counter. Why some elements capture
	electrons from the L-orbits, but not the K-orbits. General
	theory of how to fold paper to make a certain type of child’s
	toy (called flexagons). The energy levels in the light
	nuclei. The theory of turbulence (I have spent several years
	on it without success). Plus all the “grander” problems of
	quantum theory.

	<p>
	No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do
	something about it.

	<p>
	You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and
	to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate
	colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they
	come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not
	remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. now
	your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in
	terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of
	what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.

	<p>
	Best of luck and happiness.  
	
	<p>
	Sincerely, 

	<p>
	Richard P. Feynman.

      <blockquote>
	In those critical years I learned how to be alone. [But even]
	this formulation doesn't really capture my meaning. I didn't,
	in any literal sense, learn to be alone, for the simple reason
	that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my
	childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of
	our birth. However these three years of work in isolation
	[1945-1948], when I was thrown onto my own resources,
	following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously
	invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence,
	unassuming yet enduring in my ability to do mathematics, which
	owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as
	law. By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the
	things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions
	of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less
	extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for
	any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This
	silent consensus had informed me both at the lycee and at the
	university, that one shouldn't bother worrying about what was
	really meant when using a term like "volume" which was
	"obviously self-evident", "generally known," "in problematic"
	etc... it is in this gesture of "going beyond" to be in oneself
	rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay
	within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one -- it
	is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All
	others things follow as a matter of course.

	<p>
	  Since then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics
	  that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both
	  among my "elders" and among young people in my general age
	  group who were more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I
	  was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if
	  at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them
	  from the cradle -- while for myself I felt clumsy, even
	  oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb
	  ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to learn
	  (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding
	  the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed,
	  there was little about me that identified the kind of bright
	  student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates
	  almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.
	  
	  <p>
	    In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more
	    brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished
	    mathematicians. Still from the perspective of thirty or
	    thirty five years, I can state that their imprint upon the
	    mathematics of our time has not been very
	    profound. They've done all things, often beautiful things
	    in a context that was already set out before them, which
	    they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of
	    it, they've remained prisoners of those invisible and
	    despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain
	    milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they
	    would have to rediscover in themselves that capability
	    which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity
	    to be alone.

	Thurston</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jdmkUQDWtQ">The
	Mystery of 3-Manifolds</a>,
	via <a href="http://acko.net/">Steven Wittens</a></strong>

      <blockquote>
	I think a lot of mathematics is really about how you
	understand things in your head. It's people that did
	mathematics, we're not just general purpose machines, we're
	people. We see things, we feel things, we think of things. A
	lot of what I have done in my mathematical career has had to
	do with finding new ways to build models, to see things, do
	computations. Really get a feel for stuff.

	<p>
	  It may seem unimportant, but when I started out people drew
	  pictures of 3-manifolds one way and I started drawing them a
	  different way. People drew pictures of surfaces one way and
	  I started drawing them a different way.  There's something
	  significant about how the representation in your head
	  profoundly changes how you think. It's very hard to do a
	  brain dump. Very hard to do that. But I'm still going to try
	  to do something to give a feel for 3-manifolds.

	<p>
	  Words are one thing, we can talk about geometric structures,
	  there are many precise mathematical words that could be
	  used. But they don't automatically convey a feeling for
	  it. I probably can't convey a feeling for it either, but I
	  want to try.

      Auto-biographical note on the question and answer site

      <blockquote>
	Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough
	perseverence at at the fog of muddle and confusion to
	eventually break through to improved clarity. I'm happy when I
	can admit, at least to myself, that my thinking is muddled,
	and I try to overcome the embarassment that I might reveal
	ignorance or confusion. Over the years, this has helped me
	develop clarity in some things, but I remain muddled in many
	others. I enjoy questions that seem honest, even when they
	admit or reveal confusion, in preference to questions that
	appear designed to project sophistication.
      </blockquote>

      <strong>Bill
      Thurston</strong>: <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/a/44213">in
      response to a question on MathOverflow</a>

      <blockquote>
	It's not <em>mathematics</em> that you need to contribute
	to. It's deeper than that: how might you contribute to
	humanity, and even deeper, to the well-being of the world, by
	pursuing mathematics? Such a question is not possible to
	answer in a purely intellectual way, because the effects of
	our actions go far beyond our understanding. We are deeply
	social and deeply instinctual animals, so much that our
	well-being depends on many things we do that are hard to
	explain in an intellectual way. That is why you do well to
	follow your heart and your passion. Bare reason is likely to
	lead
	you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">astray</a>. None
	of us are smart and wise enough to figure it out
	intellectually.

	<p>
	  The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding. Not
	  theorems, by themselves. Is there, for example any real
	  reason that even such famous results as Fermat's Last
	  Theorem, or the Poincaré conjecture, really matter? Their
	  real importance is not in their specific statements, but
	  their role in challenging our understanding, presenting
	  challenges that led to mathematical developments that
	  increased our understanding.

	  <p>
	    The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity
	    and understanding (to put it mildly). How and whether
	    specific mathematics might lead to improving the world
	    (whatever that means) is usually impossible to tease out,
	    but mathematics collectively is extremely important.

	    <p>
	      I think of mathematics as having a large component of
	      psychology, because of its strong dependence on human
	      minds. Dehumanized mathematics would be more like
	      computer code, which is very different. Mathematical
	      ideas, even simple ideas, are often hard to transplant
	      from mind to mind. There are many ideas in mathematics
	      that may be hard to get, but are easy once you get
	      them. Because of this, mathematical understanding does
	      not expand in a monotone direction. Our understanding
	      frequently deteriorates as well. There are several
	      obvious mechanisms of decay. The experts in a subject
	      retire and die, or simply move on to other subjects and
	      forget. Mathematics is commonly explained and recorded
	      in symbolic and concrete forms that are easy to
	      communicate, rather than in conceptual forms that are
	      easy to understand once communicated. Translation in the
	      direction conceptual -> concrete and symbolic is much
	      easier than translation in the reverse direction, and
	      symbolic forms often replaces the conceptual forms of
	      understanding. And mathematical conventions and
	      taken-for-granted knowledge change, so older texts may
	      become hard to understand.

	      <p>
		In short, mathematics only exists in a living
		community of mathematicians that spreads understanding
		and breaths life into ideas both old and new. The real
		satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from
		others and sharing with others. All of us have clear
		understanding of a few things and murky concepts of
		many more. There is no way to run out of ideas in need
		of clarification. The question of who is the first
		person to ever set foot on some square meter of land
		is really secondary. Revolutionary change does matter,
		but revolutions are few, and they are not
		self-sustaining --- they depend very heavily on the
		community of mathematicians.
